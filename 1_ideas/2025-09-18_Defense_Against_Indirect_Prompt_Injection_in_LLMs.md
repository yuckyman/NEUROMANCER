# Defense Against Indirect Prompt Injection in LLMs

## summary
This paper presents InstructDetector, a detection-based approach to defend against indirect prompt injection (IPI) attacks. It detects the behavioral states of LLMs, which can help in identifying instructions embedded within external data.

Defending against Indirect Prompt Injection by Instruction Detection

arXiv:2505.06311v2 Announce Type: replace-cross Abstract: The integration of Large Language Models (LLMs) with external sources is becoming increasingly common, with Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) being a prominent example. However, this integration introduces vulnerabilities of Indirect Prompt Injection (IPI) attacks, where hidden instructions embedded in external data can manipulate LLMs into executing unintended or harmful actions. We recognize that IPI attacks fundamentally rely on the presence of instructions embedded within external content, which can alter the behavioral states of LLMs. Can the effective detection of such state changes help us defend against IPI attacks? In this paper, we propose InstructDetector, a novel detection-based approach that leverages the behavioral states of LLMs to identify potential IPI attacks. Specifically, we demonstrate the hidden states and gradients from intermediate layers provide highly discriminative features for instruction detection...

      <title>Explicit Reasoning Makes Better Judges: A Systematic Study on Accuracy, Efficiency, and Robustness</title>

      <description>arXiv:2509.13332v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: As Large Language Models (LLMs) are increasingly adopted as automated judges in benchmarking and reward modeling, ensuring their reliability, efficiency, and robustness has become critical. In this work, we present a systematic comparison of "thinking" and "non-thinking" LLMs in the LLM-as-a-judge paradigm using open-source Qwen 3 models of relatively small sizes (0.6B, 1.7B, and 4B parameters). We evaluate both accuracy and computational efficiency (FLOPs) on RewardBench tasks, and further examine augmentation strategies for non-thinking models, including in-context learning, rubric-guided judging, reference-based evaluation, and n-best aggregation. Our results show that despite these enhancements, non-thinking models generally fall short of their thinking counterparts. Our results show that thinking models achieve approximately 10% points higher accuracy with lit...
