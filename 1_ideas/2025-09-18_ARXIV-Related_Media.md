xGen-MM (BLIP-3): A Family of Open Large Multimodal Models

arXiv:2408.08872v4 Announce Type: replace Abstract: This paper introduces BLIP-3, an open framework for developing Large Multimodal Models (LMMs). The framework comprises meticulously curated datasets, a training recipe, model architectures, and a resulting suite of LMMs. We release 4B and 14B models, including both the pre-trained base model and the instruction fine-tuned ones. Our models undergo rigorous evaluation across a range of tasks, including both single and multi-image benchmarks. Our models demonstrate competitive performance among open-source LMMs with similar model sizes. Our resulting LMMs demonstrate competitive performance among open-source LMMs with similar model sizes, with the ability to comprehend interleaved image-text inputs. Our training code, models, and all datasets used in this work, including the three largescale datasets we create and the preprocessed ones, will be open-sourced to better support the research community.

      <title>Proximity-Based Evidence Retrieval for Uncertainty-Aware Neural Networks</title>

      <description>arXiv:2509.13338v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This work proposes an evidence-retrieval mechanism for uncertainty-aware decision-making that replaces a single global cutoff with an evidence-conditioned, instance-adaptive criterion. For each test instance, proximal exemplars are retrieved in an embedding space; their predictive distributions are fused via Dempster-Shafer theory. The resulting fused belief acts as a per-instance thresholding mechanism. Because the supporting evidences are explicit, decisions are transparent and auditable. Experiments on CIFAR-10/100 with BiT and ViT backbones show higher or comparable uncertainty-aware performance with materially fewer confidently incorrect outcomes and a sustainable review load compared with applying threshold on prediction entropy. Notably, only a few evidences are sufficient to realize these gains; increasing the evidence set yields only modest changes. These results indicate that evid...
