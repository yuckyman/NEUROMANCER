Generative AI for Misalignment-Resistant Virtual Staining to Accelerate Histopathology Workflows

arXiv:2509.14119v1 Announce Type: new Abstract: Accurate histopathological diagnosis often requires multiple differently stained tissue sections, a process that is time-consuming, labor-intensive, and environmentally taxing due to the use of multiple chemical stains. Recently, virtual staining has emerged as a promising alternative that is faster, tissue-conserving, and environmentally friendly. However, existing virtual staining methods face significant challenges in clinical applications, primarily due to their reliance on well-aligned paired data. Obtaining such data is inherently difficult because chemical staining processes can distort tissue structures, and a single tissue section cannot undergo multiple staining procedures without damage or loss of information. As a result, most available virtual staining datasets are either unpaired or roughly paired, making it difficult for existing methods to achieve accurate pixel-level supervision. To address this challenge, we propose a ro...

      <title>Proximity-Based Evidence Retrieval for Uncertainty-Aware Neural Networks</title>

Abstract: This work proposes an evidence-retrieval mechanism for uncertainty-aware decision-making that replaces a single global cutoff with an evidence-conditioned, instance-adaptive criterion. For each test instance, proximal exemplars are retrieved in an embedding space; their predictive distributions are fused via Dempster-Shafer theory. The resulting fused belief acts as a per-instance thresholding mechanism. Because the supporting evidences are explicit, decisions are transparent and auditable. Experiments on CIFAR-10/100 with BiT and ViT backbones show higher or comparable uncertainty-aware performance with materially fewer confidently incorrect outcomes and a sustainable review load compared with applying threshold on prediction entropy. Notably, only a few evidences are sufficient to realize these gains; increasing the evidence set yields only modest changes. These results indicate that evid...
