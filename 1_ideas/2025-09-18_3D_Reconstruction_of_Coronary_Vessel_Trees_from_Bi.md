3D Reconstruction of Coronary Vessel Trees from Biplanar X-Ray Images Using a Geometric Approach

arXiv:2509.13358v1 Announce Type: cross Abstract: X-ray angiography is widely used in cardiac interventions to visualize coronary vessels, assess integrity, detect stenoses and guide treatment. We propose a framework for reconstructing 3D vessel trees from biplanar X-ray images which are extracted from two X-ray videos captured at different C-arm angles. The proposed framework consists of three main components: image segmentation, motion phase matching, and 3D reconstruction. An automatic video segmentation method for X-ray angiography to enable semantic segmentation for image segmentation and motion phase matching. The goal of the motion phase matching is to identify a pair of X-ray images that correspond to a similar respiratory and cardiac motion phase to reduce errors in 3D reconstruction. This is achieved by tracking a stationary object such as a catheter or lead within the X-ray video. The semantic segmentation approach assigns different labels to different object classes enablin...

      <title>Proximity-Based Evidence Retrieval for Uncertainty-Aware Neural Networks</title>

Abstract: This work proposes an evidence-retrieval mechanism for uncertainty-aware decision-making that replaces a single global cutoff with an evidence-conditioned, instance-adaptive criterion. For each test instance, proximal exemplars are retrieved in an embedding space; their predictive distributions are fused via Dempster-Shafer theory. The resulting fused belief acts as a per-instance thresholding mechanism. Because the supporting evidences are explicit, decisions are transparent and auditable. Experiments on CIFAR-10/100 with BiT and ViT backbones show higher or comparable uncertainty-aware performance with materially fewer confidently incorrect outcomes and a sustainable review load compared with applying threshold on prediction entropy. Notably, only a few evidences are sufficient to realize these gains; increasing the evidence set yields only modest changes. These results indicate that evid...
