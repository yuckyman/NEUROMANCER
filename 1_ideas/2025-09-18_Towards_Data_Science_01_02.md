These posts cover the basics of setting up a RAG pipeline able to generate responses based on the content of local files. Image by author So, so far, we’ve talked about reading the documents from wherever they are stored, splitting them into text chunks, and then creating an embedding for each chunk. After that, we somehow magically pick the embeddings that are appropriate for the user query and generate a relevant response. But it’s important to further understand how the retrieval step of RAG actually works. Thus, in this post, we’ll take things a step further by taking a closer look at how the retrieval mechanism works and analyzing it in more detail. As in my previous post, I will be using the War and Peace text as an example, licensed as Public Domain and easily accessible through Project Gutenberg. What about the embeddings? In order to understand how the retrieval step of the RAG framework works, it is crucial to first understand how text is transformed and represented in embeddings. For LLMs to handle any text, it must be in the form of a vector, and to perform this transformation, we need to utilise an embedding model. An embedding is a vector representa...
