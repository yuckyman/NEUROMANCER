        &lt;div&gt;&lt;p&gt;Python 3.14 introduces improvements to its interactive shell (REPL), bringing a more modern, colorful, and user-friendly environment. The new features make the Python 3.14 REPL a powerful tool for experimentation. Whether you’re testing a quick idea, exploring a new library, or debugging a tricky snippet, the REPL gives you instant feedback—no files, no setup, just type and run.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The default CPython REPL intentionally kept things minimal. It was fast, reliable, and available everywhere, but it lacked the richer, more ergonomic features found in tools like &lt;a href=&quot;https://realpython.com/ipython-interactive-python-shell/&quot;&gt;IPython&lt;/a&gt; or &lt;a href=&quot;https://realpython.com/ptpython-shell/&quot;&gt;ptpython&lt;/a&gt;. That began to change in &lt;strong&gt;Python 3.13&lt;/strong&gt;, when CPython adopted a modern PyREPL-based shell by default, adding multiline editing, better history navigation, and smarter &lt;span class=&quot;keys&quot;&gt;&lt;kbd class=&quot;key-tab&quot;&gt;Tab&lt;/kbd&gt;&lt;/span&gt; completion.&lt;/p&gt;

When should you use the lazy or eager APIs, and what are the benefits of each? This week on the show, we speak with Jeroen Janssens and Thijs Nieuwdorp about their new book, Python Polars: The Definitive Guide. Jeroen and Thijs describe how they were introduced to Polars while working at Xomnia. They were converting a large data project to Python and saw surprising speed increases using the new library. We discuss converting projects from pandas to Polars, getting away from indexes, consistent syntax, and using lazy vs eager APIs. Along the way, Jeroen and Thijs offer tips for getting the most out of Polars in your code. We dig into the process of writing a definitive guide and the advantages of working collaboratively on a book project. They also sh...
