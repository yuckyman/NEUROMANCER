London Transport Museum Depot Open Days

London Transport Museum Depot Open Days I just found out about this (thanks, ChatGPT) and I'm heart-broken to learn that I'm in London a week too early! If you are in London next week (Thursday 18th through Sunday 21st 2025) you should definitely know about it: The Museum Depot in Acton is our working museum store, and a treasure trove of over 320,000 objects. Three times a year, we throw open the doors and welcome thousands of visitors to explore. Discover rare road and rail vehicles spanning over 100 years, signs, ceramic tiles, original posters, ephemera, ticket machines, and more. And if you can go on Saturday 20th or Sunday 21st you can ride the small-scale railway there! The Depot is also home to the London Transport Miniature Railway, a working miniature railway based on real London Underground locomotives, carriages, signals and signs run by our volunteers. Note that this "miniature railway" is not the same thing as a model railway - it uses a 7¼ in gauge railway and you can si...

Anthropic had a very bad month in terms of model reliability:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Between August and early September, three infrastructure bugs intermittently degraded Claude's response quality. We've now resolved these issues and want to explain what happened. [...]&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To state it plainly: We never reduce model quality due to demand, time of day, or server load. The problems our users reported were due to infrastructure bugs alone. [...]&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We don't typically share this level of technical detail about our infrastructure, but the scope and complexity of these issues justified a more comprehensive explanation.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I'm really glad Anthropic are publishing this in so much detail. Their reputation for serving their models reliably has taken a notable hit.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I hadn't appreciated the additional complexity caused by their mixture of different serving platforms:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We deploy Claude across multiple hardwar...
