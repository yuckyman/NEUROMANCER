Did you know that machine learning engineers are currently the highest-paid tech professionals in the UK? According to Levels.fyi, the average salary is almost £100k — higher than software engineers, AI engineers, and data scientists. But it’s not just about the paycheque. As a machine learning engineer, you get to tackle fascinating problems, experiment with cutting-edge tools, and actually positively affect the world. I can tell you from first hand experience — it’s one of the most exciting and fulfilling jobs. So in this article, I’ll give you a clear and simple learning roadmap to becoming a machine learning engineer, along with the best resources. Let’s get into it! Maths and Statistics I have said it time and time again, but maths and statistics are by far the most important things you should learn if you want a career in machine learning or in data as a whole. Technologies come and go, think blockchain and AI, but maths remains a fundamental staple throughout the centuries. Fortunately, you don&#8217;t need to be some maths genius to work in machine learning, I can wholeheartedly confirm this from first-hand experience. The level of maths required is equivalent is most of the things you get taught in your final years of high school and first year or two of an undergraduate STEM degree. In general, there are three areas of maths you need to study: Linear Algebra — To learn about matrices, eigenvalues and vectors. These are used everywhere in areas like principal compo...
