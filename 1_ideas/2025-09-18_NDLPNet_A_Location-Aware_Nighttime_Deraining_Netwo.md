NDLPNet: A Location-Aware Nighttime Deraining Network and a Real-World Benchmark Dataset

arXiv:2509.13766v1 Announce Type: new Abstract: Visual degradation caused by rain streak artifacts in low-light conditions significantly hampers the performance of nighttime surveillance and autonomous navigation. Existing image deraining techniques are primarily designed for daytime conditions and perform poorly under nighttime illumination due to the spatial heterogeneity of rain distribution and the impact of light-dependent stripe visibility. In this paper, we propose a novel Nighttime Deraining Location-enhanced Perceptual Network(NDLPNet) that effectively captures the spatial positional information and density distribution of rain streaks in low-light environments. Specifically, we introduce a Position Perception Module (PPM) to capture and leverage spatial contextual information from input data, enhancing the model's capability to identify and recalibrate the importance of different feature channels. The proposed nighttime deraining network can effectively remove the rain streak...

      <title>Proximity-Based Evidence Retrieval for Uncertainty-Aware Neural Networks</title>

Abstract: This work proposes an evidence-retrieval mechanism for uncertainty-aware decision-making that replaces a single global cutoff with an evidence-conditioned, instance-adaptive criterion. For each test instance, proximal exemplars are retrieved in an embedding space; their predictive distributions are fused via Dempster-Shafer theory. The resulting fused belief acts as a per-instance thresholding mechanism. Because the supporting evidences are explicit, decisions are transparent and auditable. Experiments on CIFAR-10/100 with BiT and ViT backbones show higher or comparable uncertainty-aware performance with materially fewer confidently incorrect outcomes and a sustainable review load compared with applying threshold on prediction entropy. Notably, only a few evidences are sufficient to realize these gains; increasing the evidence set yields only modest changes. These results indicate that evid...
