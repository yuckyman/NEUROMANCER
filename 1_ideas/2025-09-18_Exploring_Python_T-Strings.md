        &lt;div&gt;&lt;p&gt;Python 3.14 introduces improvements to its interactive shell (REPL), bringing a more modern, colorful, and user-friendly environment. The new features make the Python 3.14 REPL a powerful tool for experimentation. Whether you’re testing a quick idea, exploring a new library, or debugging a tricky snippet, the REPL gives you instant feedback—no files, no setup, just type and run.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The default CPython REPL intentionally kept things minimal. It was fast, reliable, and available everywhere, but it lacked the richer, more ergonomic features found in tools like &lt;a href=&quot;https://realpython.com/ipython-interactive-python-shell/&quot;&gt;IPython&lt;/a&gt; or &lt;a href=&quot;https://realpython.com/ptpython-shell/&quot;&gt;ptpython&lt;/a&gt;. That began to change in &lt;strong&gt;Python 3.13&lt;/strong&gt;, when CPython adopted a modern PyREPL-based shell by default, adding multiline editing, better history navigation, and smarter &lt;span class=&quot;keys&quot;&gt;&lt;kbd class=&quot;key-tab&quot;&gt;Tab&lt;/kbd&gt;&lt;/span&gt; completion.&lt;/p&gt;

Unlike f-strings, which produce a str object, t-strings resolve to a Template instance, allowing you to safely process and customize dynamic content. One of the key benefits of t-strings is their ability to help prevent security vulnerabilities like SQL injection and XSS attacks. They&rsquo;re also valuable in other fields that rely on string templates, such as structured logging. By the end of this video course, you&rsquo;ll understand that: Python t-strings are a generalization of f-strings, designed to safely handle and process input values. The main components of a t-string include static string parts and interpolations, which are accessible through the Template class. You process t-strings by iterating over their components, using attributes such as .strings, .interpolations, and .values for safe and customized handling.
