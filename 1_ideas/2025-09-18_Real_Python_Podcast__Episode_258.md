        &lt;div&gt;&lt;p&gt;Python 3.14 introduces improvements to its interactive shell (REPL), bringing a more modern, colorful, and user-friendly environment. The new features make the Python 3.14 REPL a powerful tool for experimentation. Whether you’re testing a quick idea, exploring a new library, or debugging a tricky snippet, the REPL gives you instant feedback—no files, no setup, just type and run.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The default CPython REPL intentionally kept things minimal.

This week on the show, we speak with Maria Ashna about her first year as the inaugural PyPI Support Specialist. Maria has a varied background in creative arts and neuroscience. She decided to apply for the PyPI support position, defying common misconceptions about who can take on roles inside the Python Software Foundation, and challenging imposter syndrome along the way. Her recent talks at PyCon US 2025 and EuroPython 2025 were about her experiences in the role. She describes tackling the backlogs of account recovery and PEP 541 requests, and we also discuss PyPI community and company organizations.
