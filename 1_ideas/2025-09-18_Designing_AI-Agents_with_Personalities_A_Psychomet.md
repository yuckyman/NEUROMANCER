Designing AI-Agents with Personalities: A Psychometric Approach

arXiv:2410.19238v2 Announce Type: replace Abstract: We introduce a methodology for assigning quantifiable and psychometrically validated personalities to AI-Agents using the Big Five framework. Across three studies, we evaluate its feasibility and limits. In Study 1, we show that large language models (LLMs) capture semantic similarities among Big Five measures, providing a basis for personality assignment. In Study 2, we create AI-Agents using prompts designed based on the Big Five Inventory (BFI-2) in the Likert or Expanded format, and find that, when paired with newer LLMs (e.g., GPT-4, GPT-4o, Llama, DeepSeek), these AI-Agents align more closely with human responses on the Mini-Markers test than those generated with binary adjective prompts or older models, although the finer pattern of results (e.g., factor loading patterns) were not consistent between AI-Agents and human participants. In Study 3, we validate our AI-Agents with risk-taking and moral dilemma vignettes. We find that...

      <title>Explicit Reasoning Makes Better Judges: A Systematic Study on Accuracy, Efficiency, and Robustness</title>

      <description>arXiv:2509.13332v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: As Large Language Models (LLMs) are increasingly adopted as automated judges in benchmarking and reward modeling, ensuring their reliability, efficiency, and robustness has become critical. In this work, we present a systematic comparison of "thinking" and "non-thinking" LLMs in the LLM-as-a-judge paradigm using open-source Qwen 3 models of relatively small sizes (0.6B, 1.7B, and 4B parameters). We evaluate both accuracy and computational efficiency (FLOPs) on RewardBench tasks, and further examine augmentation strategies for non-thinking models, including in-context learning, rubric-guided judging, reference-based evaluation, and n-best aggregation. Our results show that despite these enhancements, non-thinking models generally fall short of their thinking counterparts. Our results show that thinking models achieve approximately 10% points higher accuracy with lit...
