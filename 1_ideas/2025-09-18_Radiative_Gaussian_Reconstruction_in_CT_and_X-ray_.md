# Radiative Gaussian Reconstruction in CT and X-ray Computed Laminography

## summary
This paper presents a new method called 'LamiGauss' for the reconstruction of high-quality volumes from laminographic projections. LamiGauss combines Gaussian Splatting with a specialized detector-to-world transformation to effectively address challenges in X-ray computed laminate (CL) imaging, particularly in sparse-view acquisition conditions.

LamiGauss: Pitching Radiative Gaussian for Sparse-View X-ray Laminography Reconstruction

arXiv:2509.13863v1 Announce Type: new Abstract: X-ray Computed Laminography (CL) is essential for non-destructive inspection of plate-like structures in applications such as microchips and composite battery materials, where traditional computed tomography (CT) struggles due to geometric constraints. However, reconstructing high-quality volumes from laminographic projections remains challenging, particularly under highly sparse-view acquisition conditions. In this paper, we propose a reconstruction algorithm, namely LamiGauss, that combines Gaussian Splatting radiative rasterization with a dedicated detector-to-world transformation model incorporating the laminographic tilt angle. LamiGauss leverages an initialization strategy that explicitly filters out common laminographic artifacts from the preliminary reconstruction, preventing redundant Gaussians from being allocated to false structures and thereby concentrating model capacity on representing the genuine object. Our approach effect...

      <title>Proximity-Based Evidence Retrieval for Uncertainty-Aware Neural Networks</title>

Abstract: This work proposes an evidence-retrieval mechanism for uncertainty-aware decision-making that replaces a single global cutoff with an evidence-conditioned, instance-adaptive criterion. For each test instance, proximal exemplars are retrieved in an embedding space; their predictive distributions are fused via Dempster-Shafer theory. The resulting fused belief acts as a per-instance thresholding mechanism. Because the supporting evidences are explicit, decisions are transparent and auditable. Experiments on CIFAR-10/100 with BiT and ViT backbones show higher or comparable uncertainty-aware performance with materially fewer confidently incorrect outcomes and a sustainable review load compared with applying threshold on prediction entropy. Notably, only a few evidences are sufficient to realize these gains; increasing the evidence set yields only modest changes. These results indicate that evid...
