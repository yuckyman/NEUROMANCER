# Unmanned Aerial Vehicle (UAV) Frameworks: A New Approach for Autonomous Decis...

## summary
This paper introduces a new framework for UAVs that integrates Large Language Model (LLM) agents with tool-calling to enhance their autonomy. It describes a five-layer architecture (Perception, Reasoning, Action, Integration, Learning) that addresses the limitations of current UAV frameworks.

Agentic UAVs: LLM-Driven Autonomy with Integrated Tool-Calling and Cognitive Reasoning

arXiv:2509.13352v1 Announce Type: new Abstract: Unmanned Aerial Vehicles (UAVs) are increasingly deployed in defense, surveillance, and disaster response, yet most systems remain confined to SAE Level 2--3 autonomy. Their reliance on rule-based control and narrow AI restricts adaptability in dynamic, uncertain missions. Existing UAV frameworks lack context-aware reasoning, autonomous decision-making, and ecosystem-level integration; critically, none leverage Large Language Model (LLM) agents with tool-calling for real-time knowledge access. This paper introduces the Agentic UAVs framework, a five-layer architecture (Perception, Reasoning, Action, Integration, Learning) that augments UAVs with LLM-driven reasoning, database querying, and third-party system interaction. A ROS2 and Gazebo-based prototype integrates YOLOv11 object detection with GPT-4 reasoning and local Gemma-3 deployment. In simulated search-and-rescue scenarios, agentic UAVs achieved higher detection confidence (0.79 vs...

      <title>Explicit Reasoning Makes Better Judges: A Systematic Study on Accuracy, Efficiency, and Robustness</title>

      <description>arXiv:2509.13332v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: As Large Language Models (LLMs) are increasingly adopted as automated judges in benchmarking and reward modeling, ensuring their reliability, efficiency, and robustness has become critical. In this work, we present a systematic comparison of "thinking" and "non-thinking" LLMs in the LLM-as-a-judge paradigm using open-source Qwen 3 models of relatively small sizes (0.6B, 1.7B, and 4B parameters). We evaluate both accuracy and computational efficiency (FLOPs) on RewardBench tasks, and further examine augmentation strategies for non-thinking models, including in-context learning, rubric-guided judging, reference-based evaluation, and n-best aggregation. Our results show that despite these enhancements, non-thinking models generally fall short of their thinking counterparts. Our results show that thinking models achieve approximately 10% points higher accuracy with lit...
