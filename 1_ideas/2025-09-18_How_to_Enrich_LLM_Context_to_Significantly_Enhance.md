Image by ChatGPT. LLMs are trained with an enormous corpus of text data, where they, during their pre-training stage, essentially consume the entire internet. LLMs thrive when they have access to all relevant data to respond to user questions appropriately. However, in many cases, we limit the capabilities of our LLMs by not providing them enough data. In this article, I&#8217;ll discuss why you should care about feeding our LLM more data, how to fetch this data, and specific applications. I&#8217;ll also start with a new feature in my articles: Writing out my main goal, what I want to achieve with the article, and what you should know after reading it. If successful, I&#8217;ll start writing it into each of my articles: My goal for this article is to highlight the importance of providing LLMs with relevant data, and how you can feed it into your LLMs for improved performance In this article, I highlight how you can enhance LLM performance by feeding more data into your LLMs. Image by ChatGPT.
