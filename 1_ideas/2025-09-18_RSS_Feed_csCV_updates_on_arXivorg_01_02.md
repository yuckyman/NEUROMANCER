Well-Conditioned Polynomial Representations for Mathematical Handwriting Recognition

arXiv:2509.10815v2 Announce Type: replace Abstract: Previous work has made use of a parameterized plane curve polynomial representation for mathematical handwriting, with the polynomials represented in a Legendre or Legendre-Sobolev graded basis. This provides a compact geometric representation for the digital ink. Preliminary results have also been shown for Chebyshev and Chebyshev-Sobolev bases. This article explores the trade-offs between basis choice and polynomial degree to achieve accurate modeling with a low computational cost. To do this, we consider the condition number for polynomial evaluation in these bases and bound how the various inner products give norms for the variations between symbols.

      <title>Proximity-Based Evidence Retrieval for Uncertainty-Aware Neural Networks</title>

Abstract: This work proposes an evidence-retrieval mechanism for uncertainty-aware decision-making that replaces a single global cutoff with an evidence-conditioned, instance-adaptive criterion. For each test instance, proximal exemplars are retrieved in an embedding space; their predictive distributions are fused via Dempster-Shafer theory. The resulting fused belief acts as a per-instance thresholding mechanism. Because the supporting evidences are explicit, decisions are transparent and auditable. Experiments on CIFAR-10/100 with BiT and ViT backbones show higher or comparable uncertainty-aware performance with materially fewer confidently incorrect outcomes and a sustainable review load compared with applying threshold on prediction entropy. Notably, only a few evidences are sufficient to realize these gains; increasing the evidence set yields only modest changes. These results indicate that evid...
