Like many data scientists, my daily toolbox for data analytics is built on NumPy and Pandas.&nbsp; To stay in my comfort zone, I often outsourced calculations to external APIs instead of using n8n JavaScript code nodes. Production Planning n8n workflow with API function calling &#8211; (Image by Samir Saci) For instance, this is what is done with a Production Planning Optimisation tool, which is orchestrated through a workflow that includes an Agent node that calls a FastAPI microservice. This approach worked, but I had clients who requested to have complete visibility of the data analytics tasks on their n8n user interface. I realised that I need to learn just enough JavaScript to perform data processing with the native code nodes of n8n. Example of JavaScript node grouping sales by ITEM &#8211; (Image by Samir Saci) In this article, we will experiment with small JavaScript snippets inside n8n Code nodes to perform everyday data analytics tasks. For this exercise, I will use a dataset of sales transactions and walk it through to an ABC and Paret...
