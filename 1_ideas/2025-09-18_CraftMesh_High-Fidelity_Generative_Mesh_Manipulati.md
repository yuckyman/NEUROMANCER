# CraftMesh: High-Fidelity Generative Mesh Manipulation via Poisson Seamless Fu...

## summary
CraftMesh is a framework that enables high-fidelity generative mesh editing by breaking down the process into a pipeline of 2D and 3D generative models. It introduces Poisson Geometric Fusion, which combines geometric integration techniques with normal blending to achieve harmonious geometric integration and seamless fusion.

CraftMesh: High-Fidelity Generative Mesh Manipulation via Poisson Seamless Fusion

arXiv:2509.13688v1 Announce Type: cross Abstract: Controllable, high-fidelity mesh editing remains a significant challenge in 3D content creation. Existing generative methods often struggle with complex geometries and fail to produce detailed results. We propose CraftMesh, a novel framework for high-fidelity generative mesh manipulation via Poisson Seamless Fusion. Our key insight is to decompose mesh editing into a pipeline that leverages the strengths of 2D and 3D generative models: we edit a 2D reference image, then generate a region-specific 3D mesh, and seamlessly fuse it into the original model. We introduce two core techniques: Poisson Geometric Fusion, which utilizes a hybrid SDF/Mesh representation with normal blending to achieve harmonious geometric integration, and Poisson Texture Harmonization for visually consistent texture blending. Experimental results demonstrate that CraftMesh outperforms state-of-the-art methods, delivering superior global consistency and local detail...

      <title>Explicit Reasoning Makes Better Judges: A Systematic Study on Accuracy, Efficiency, and Robustness</title>

      <description>arXiv:2509.13332v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: As Large Language Models (LLMs) are increasingly adopted as automated judges in benchmarking and reward modeling, ensuring their reliability, efficiency, and robustness has become critical. In this work, we present a systematic comparison of "thinking" and "non-thinking" LLMs in the LLM-as-a-judge paradigm using open-source Qwen 3 models of relatively small sizes (0.6B, 1.7B, and 4B parameters). We evaluate both accuracy and computational efficiency (FLOPs) on RewardBench tasks, and further examine augmentation strategies for non-thinking models, including in-context learning, rubric-guided judging, reference-based evaluation, and n-best aggregation. Our results show that despite these enhancements, non-thinking models generally fall short of their thinking counterparts. Our results show that thinking models achieve approximately 10% points higher accuracy with lit...
