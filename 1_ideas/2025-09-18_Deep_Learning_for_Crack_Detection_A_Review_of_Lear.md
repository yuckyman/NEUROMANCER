Deep Learning for Crack Detection: A Review of Learning Paradigms, Generalizability, and Datasets

arXiv:2508.10256v2 Announce Type: replace Abstract: Crack detection plays a crucial role in civil infrastructures, including inspection of pavements, buildings, etc., and deep learning has significantly advanced this field in recent years. While numerous technical and review papers exist in this domain, emerging trends are reshaping the landscape. These shifts include transitions in learning paradigms (from fully supervised learning to semi-supervised, weakly-supervised, unsupervised, few-shot, domain adaptation and fine-tuning foundation models), improvements in generalizability (from single-dataset performance to cross-dataset evaluation), and diversification in dataset acquisition (from RGB images to specialized sensor-based data). In this review, we systematically analyze these trends and highlight representative works. Additionally, we introduce a new annotated dataset collected with 3D laser scans, 3DCrack, to support future research and conduct extensive benchmarking experiments...

      <title>Proximity-Based Evidence Retrieval for Uncertainty-Aware Neural Networks</title>

      <description>arXiv:2509.13338v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This work proposes an evidence-retrieval mechanism for uncertainty-aware decision-making that replaces a single global cutoff with an evidence-conditioned, instance-adaptive criterion. For each test instance, proximal exemplars are retrieved in an embedding space; their predictive distributions are fused via Dempster-Shafer theory. The resulting fused belief acts as a per-instance thresholding mechanism. Because the supporting evidences are explicit, decisions are transparent and auditable. Experiments on CIFAR-10/100 with BiT and ViT backbones show higher or comparable uncertainty-aware performance with materially fewer confidently incorrect outcomes and a sustainable review load compared with applying threshold on prediction entropy. Notably, only a few evidences are sufficient to realize these gains; increasing the evidence set yields only modest changes. These results indicate that evid...
