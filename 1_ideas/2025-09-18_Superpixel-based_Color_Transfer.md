Superpixel-based Color Transfer

arXiv:1903.06010v2 Announce Type: replace Abstract: In this work, we propose a fast superpixel-based color transfer method (SCT) between two images. Superpixels enable to decrease the image dimension and to extract a reduced set of color candidates. We propose to use a fast approximate nearest neighbor matching algorithm in which we enforce the match diversity by limiting the selection of the same superpixels. A fusion framework is designed to transfer the matched colors, and we demonstrate the improvement obtained over exact matching results. Finally, we show that SCT is visually competitive compared to state-of-the-art methods.

      <title>Proximity-Based Evidence Retrieval for Uncertainty-Aware Neural Networks</title>

      <description>arXiv:2509.13338v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This work proposes an evidence-retrieval mechanism for uncertainty-aware decision-making that replaces a single global cutoff with an evidence-conditioned, instance-adaptive criterion. For each test instance, proximal exemplars are retrieved in an embedding space; their predictive distributions are fused via Dempster-Shafer theory. The resulting fused belief acts as a per-instance thresholding mechanism. Because the supporting evidences are explicit, decisions are transparent and auditable. Experiments on CIFAR-10/100 with BiT and ViT backbones show higher or comparable uncertainty-aware performance with materially fewer confidently incorrect outcomes and a sustainable review load compared with applying threshold on prediction entropy. Notably, only a few evidences are sufficient to realize these gains; increasing the evidence set yields only modest changes. These results indicate that evid...
