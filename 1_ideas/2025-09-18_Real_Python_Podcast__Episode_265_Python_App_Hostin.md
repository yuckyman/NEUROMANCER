        &lt;div&gt;&lt;p&gt;Python 3.14 introduces improvements to its interactive shell (REPL), bringing a more modern, colorful, and user-friendly environment. The new features make the Python 3.14 REPL a powerful tool for experimentation. Whether you’re testing a quick idea, exploring a new library, or debugging a tricky snippet, the REPL gives you instant feedback—no files, no setup, just type and run.&lt;/p&gt;

That began to change in &lt;strong&gt;Python 3.13&lt;/strong&gt;, when CPython adopted a modern PyREPL-based shell by default, adding multiline editing, better history navigation, and smarter &lt;span class=&quot;keys&quot;&gt;&lt;kbd class=&quot;key-tab&quot;&gt;Tab&lt;/kbd&gt;&lt;/span&gt; completion.&lt;/p&gt;

Christopher Trudeau is back on the show this week, bringing another batch of PyCoder&rsquo;s Weekly articles and projects. Episode Sponsor: We discuss a recent article about hosting Python applications. The piece digs into the differences between using containers or platform-provided tools to automatically configure your project. We also cover an older article listing several free hosting options for smaller projects or Python scripts. The Python documentary premiered this past week, and we provide a synopsis and our thoughts. Following a similar theme, we cover our recent code conversation video course, which e...
