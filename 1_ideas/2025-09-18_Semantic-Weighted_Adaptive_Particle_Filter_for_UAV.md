SWA-PF: Semantic-Weighted Adaptive Particle Filter for Memory-Efficient 4-DoF UAV Localization in GNSS-Denied Environments

arXiv:2509.13795v1 Announce Type: new Abstract: Vision-based Unmanned Aerial Vehicle (UAV) localization systems have been extensively investigated for Global Navigation Satellite System (GNSS)-denied environments. However, existing retrieval-based approaches face limitations in dataset availability and persistent challenges including suboptimal real-time performance, environmental sensitivity, and limited generalization capability, particularly in dynamic or temporally varying environments. To overcome these limitations, we present a large-scale Multi-Altitude Flight Segments dataset (MAFS) for variable altitude scenarios and propose a novel Semantic-Weighted Adaptive Particle Filter (SWA-PF) method. This approach integrates robust semantic features from both UAV-captured images and satellite imagery through two key innovations: a semantic weighting mechanism and an optimized particle filtering architecture. Evaluated using our dataset, the proposed method achieves 10x computational ef...

      <title>Proximity-Based Evidence Retrieval for Uncertainty-Aware Neural Networks</title>

Abstract: This work proposes an evidence-retrieval mechanism for uncertainty-aware decision-making that replaces a single global cutoff with an evidence-conditioned, instance-adaptive criterion. For each test instance, proximal exemplars are retrieved in an embedding space; their predictive distributions are fused via Dempster-Shafer theory. The resulting fused belief acts as a per-instance thresholding mechanism. Because the supporting evidences are explicit, decisions are transparent and auditable. Experiments on CIFAR-10/100 with BiT and ViT backbones show higher or comparable uncertainty-aware performance with materially fewer confidently incorrect outcomes and a sustainable review load compared with applying threshold on prediction entropy. Notably, only a few evidences are sufficient to realize these gains; increasing the evidence set yields only modest changes. These results indicate that evid...
