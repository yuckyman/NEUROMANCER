Quoting Apple Security Engineering and Architecture

There has never been a successful, widespread malware attack against iPhone. The only system-level iOS attacks we observe in the wild come from mercenary spyware, which is vastly more complex than regular cybercriminal activity and consumer malware. Mercenary spyware is historically associated with state actors and uses exploit chains that cost millions of dollars to target a very small number of specific individuals and their devices. [...] Known mercenary spyware chains used against iOS share a common denominator with those targeting Windows and Android: they exploit memory safety vulnerabilities, which are interchangeable, powerful, and exist throughout the industry. &mdash; Apple Security Engineering and Architecture, introducing Memory Integrity Enforcement for iPhone 17 Tags: apple, privacy, security

Anthropic had a very bad month in terms of model reliability:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Between August and early September, three infrastructure bugs intermittently degraded Claude's response quality. We've now resolved these issues and want to explain what happened. [...]&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To state it plainly: We never reduce model quality due to demand, time of day, or server load. The problems our users reported were due to infrastructure bugs alone. [...]&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We don't typically share this level of technical detail about our infrastructure, but the scope and complexity of these issues justified a more comprehensive explanation.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I'm really glad Anthropic are publishing this in so much detail. Their reputation for serving their models reliably has taken a notable hit.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I hadn't appreciated the additional complexity caused by their mixture of different serving platforms:&lt;/p&gt;
