Smart business leaders look ahead and take AI safety, security, and trust seriously before problems show up. At the IEEE panel Beyond Accuracy: Engineering Trustworthy AI in Production, five experienced practitioners in all the stages of the AI development life cycle shared their lessons from the field about how to make AI trustworthy while also deploying valuable solutions that move business metrics. In this article, four of the expert panelists each tackle one common myth about AI trust and explain what you need to know to make your AI projects a trustworthy, safe success.
