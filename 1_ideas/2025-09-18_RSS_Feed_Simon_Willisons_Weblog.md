Quoting Kumar Aditya

In Python 3.14, I have implemented several changes to fix thread safety of asyncio and enable it to scale effectively on the free-threaded build of CPython. It is now implemented using lock-free data structures and per-thread state, allowing for highly efficient task management and execution across multiple threads. In the general case of multiple event loops running in parallel, there is no lock contention and performance scales linearly with the number of threads. [...] For a deeper dive into the implementation, check out the internal docs for asyncio. &mdash; Kumar Aditya, Scaling asyncio on Free-Threaded Python Tags: async, scaling, python, gil, threads

Anthropic had a very bad month in terms of model reliability:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Between August and early September, three infrastructure bugs intermittently degraded Claude's response quality. We've now resolved these issues and want to explain what happened. [...]&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To state it plainly: We never reduce model quality due to demand, time of day, or server load. The problems our users reported were due to infrastructure bugs alone. [...]&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We don't typically share this level of technical detail about our infrastructure, but the scope and complexity of these issues justified a more comprehensive explanation.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I'm really glad Anthropic are publishing this in so much detail. Their reputation for serving their models reliably has taken a notable hit.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I hadn't appreciated the additional complexity caused by their mixture of different serving platforms:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We deploy Claude across multiple hardwar...
