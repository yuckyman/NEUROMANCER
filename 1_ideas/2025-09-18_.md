Unlocking Legal Knowledge: A Multilingual Dataset for Judicial Summarization in Switzerland

arXiv:2410.13456v2 Announce Type: replace-cross Abstract: Legal research is a time-consuming task that most lawyers face on a daily basis. A large part of legal research entails looking up relevant caselaw and bringing it in relation to the case at hand. Lawyers heavily rely on summaries (also called headnotes) to find the right cases quickly. However, not all decisions are annotated with headnotes and writing them is time-consuming. Automated headnote creation has the potential to make hundreds of thousands of decisions more accessible for legal research in Switzerland alone. To kickstart this, we introduce the Swiss Leading Decision Summarization ( SLDS) dataset, a novel cross-lingual resource featuring 18K court rulings from the Swiss Federal Supreme Court (SFSC), in German, French, and Italian, along with German headnotes. We fine-tune and evaluate three mT5 variants, along with proprietary models. Our analysis highlights that while proprietary models perform well in zero-shot and ...

      <title>Explicit Reasoning Makes Better Judges: A Systematic Study on Accuracy, Efficiency, and Robustness</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.13332</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.13332v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: As Large Language Models (LLMs) are increasingly adopted as automated judges in benchmarking and reward modeling, ensuring their reliability, efficiency, and robustness has become critical. In this work, we present a systematic comparison of "thinking" and "non-thinking" LLMs in the LLM-as-a-judge paradigm using open-source Qwen 3 models of relatively small sizes (0.6B, 1.7B, and 4B parameters). We evaluate both accuracy and computational efficiency (FLOPs) on RewardBench tasks, and further examine augmentation strategies for non-thinking models, including in-context learning, rubric-guided judging, reference-based evaluation, and n-best aggregation. Our results show that despite these enhancements, non-thinking models generally fall short of their thinking counterparts. Our results show that thinking models achieve approximately 10% points higher accuracy with lit...
