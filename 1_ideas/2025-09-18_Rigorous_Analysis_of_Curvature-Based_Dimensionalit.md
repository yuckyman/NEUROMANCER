# Rigorous Analysis of Curvature-Based Dimensionality Reduction in Metric Spaces

## summary
We introduce a curvature-based analysis for evaluating the effectiveness of data representations, such as those produced by dimensionality reduction techniques. This method is based on a metric profile derived from curvatures between triples of points.

Curvature as a tool for evaluating dimensionality reduction and estimating intrinsic dimension

arXiv:2509.13385v1 Announce Type: new Abstract: Utilizing recently developed abstract notions of sectional curvature, we introduce a method for constructing a curvature-based geometric profile of discrete metric spaces. The curvature concept that we use here captures the metric relations between triples of points and other points. More significantly, based on this curvature profile, we introduce a quantitative measure to evaluate the effectiveness of data representations, such as those produced by dimensionality reduction techniques. Furthermore, Our experiments demonstrate that this curvature-based analysis can be employed to estimate the intrinsic dimensionality of datasets. We use this to explore the large-scale geometry of empirical networks and to evaluate the effectiveness of dimensionality reduction techniques.

Abstract: This work proposes an evidence-retrieval mechanism for uncertainty-aware decision-making that replaces a single global cutoff with an evidence-conditioned, instance-adaptive criterion. For each test instance, proximal exemplars are retrieved in an embedding space; their predictive distributions are fused via Dempster-Shafer theory. The resulting fused belief acts as a per-instance thresholding mechanism. Because the supporting evidences are explicit, decisions are transparent and auditable. Experiments on CIFAR-10/100 with BiT and ViT backbones show higher or comparable uncertainty-aware performance with materially fewer confidently incorrect outcomes and a sustainable review load compared with applying threshold on prediction entropy. Notably, only a few evidences are sufficient to realize these gains; increasing the evidence set yields only modest changes. These results indicate that evid...
