Parking Space Ground Truth Test Automation by Artificial Intelligence Using Convolutional Neural Networks

arXiv:2509.13366v1 Announce Type: new Abstract: This research is part of a study of a real-time, cloud-based on-street parking service using crowd-sourced in-vehicle fleet data. The service provides real-time information about available parking spots by classifying crowd-sourced detections observed via ultrasonic sensors. The goal of this research is to optimize the current parking service quality by analyzing the automation of the existing test process for ground truth tests. Therefore, methods from the field of machine learning, especially image pattern recognition, are applied to enrich the database and substitute human engineering work in major areas of the analysis process. After an introduction into the related areas of machine learning, this paper explains the methods and implementations made to achieve a high level of automation, applying convolutional neural networks. Finally, predefined metrics present the performance level achieved, showing a time reduction of human resource...

      <title>Proximity-Based Evidence Retrieval for Uncertainty-Aware Neural Networks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.13338</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.13338v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This work proposes an evidence-retrieval mechanism for uncertainty-aware decision-making that replaces a single global cutoff with an evidence-conditioned, instance-adaptive criterion. For each test instance, proximal exemplars are retrieved in an embedding space; their predictive distributions are fused via Dempster-Shafer theory. The resulting fused belief acts as a per-instance thresholding mechanism. Because the supporting evidences are explicit, decisions are transparent and auditable. Experiments on CIFAR-10/100 with BiT and ViT backbones show higher or comparable uncertainty-aware performance with materially fewer confidently incorrect outcomes and a sustainable review load compared with applying threshold on prediction entropy. Notably, only a few evidences are sufficient to realize these gains; increasing the evidence set yields only modest changes. These results indicate that evid...
