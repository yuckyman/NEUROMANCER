PREDICT-GBM: Platform for Robust Evaluation and Development of Individualized Computational Tumor Models in Glioblastoma

arXiv:2509.13360v1 Announce Type: cross Abstract: Glioblastoma is the most prevalent primary brain malignancy, distinguished by its highly invasive behavior and exceptionally high rates of recurrence. Conventional radiation therapy, which employs uniform treatment margins, fails to account for patient-specific anatomical and biological factors that critically influence tumor cell migration. To address this limitation, numerous computational models of glioblastoma growth have been developed, enabling generation of tumor cell distribution maps extending beyond radiographically visible regions and thus informing more precise treatment strategies. However, despite encouraging preliminary findings, the clinical adoption of these growth models remains limited. To bridge this translational gap and accelerate both model development and clinical validation, we introduce PREDICT-GBM, a comprehensive integrated pipeline and dataset for modeling and evaluation. This platform enables systematic ben...

      <title>Proximity-Based Evidence Retrieval for Uncertainty-Aware Neural Networks</title>

Abstract: This work proposes an evidence-retrieval mechanism for uncertainty-aware decision-making that replaces a single global cutoff with an evidence-conditioned, instance-adaptive criterion. For each test instance, proximal exemplars are retrieved in an embedding space; their predictive distributions are fused via Dempster-Shafer theory. The resulting fused belief acts as a per-instance thresholding mechanism. Because the supporting evidences are explicit, decisions are transparent and auditable. Experiments on CIFAR-10/100 with BiT and ViT backbones show higher or comparable uncertainty-aware performance with materially fewer confidently incorrect outcomes and a sustainable review load compared with applying threshold on prediction entropy. Notably, only a few evidences are sufficient to realize these gains; increasing the evidence set yields only modest changes. These results indicate that evid...
