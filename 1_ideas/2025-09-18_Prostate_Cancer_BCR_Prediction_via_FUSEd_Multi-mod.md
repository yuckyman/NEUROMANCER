# Prostate Cancer BCR Prediction via FUSEd Multi-modal Embeddings

## summary
We propose a method called PROFUSEme (Prostate Cancer BCR Prediction via FUSEd Multi-modal Embeddings) that combines clinical, radiology, and pathology data to predict prostate cancer biochemical recurrence (BCR). The approach uses an intermediate fusion configuration in combination with Cox Proportional Hazard regressors.

PROFUSEme: PROstate Cancer Biochemical Recurrence Prediction via FUSEd Multi-modal Embeddings

arXiv:2509.14051v1 Announce Type: new Abstract: Almost 30% of prostate cancer (PCa) patients undergoing radical prostatectomy (RP) experience biochemical recurrence (BCR), characterized by increased prostate specific antigen (PSA) and associated with increased mortality. Accurate early prediction of BCR, at the time of RP, would contribute to prompt adaptive clinical decision-making and improved patient outcomes. In this work, we propose prostate cancer BCR prediction via fused multi-modal embeddings (PROFUSEme), which learns cross-modal interactions of clinical, radiology, and pathology data, following an intermediate fusion configuration in combination with Cox Proportional Hazard regressors. Quantitative evaluation of our proposed approach reveals superior performance, when compared with late fusion configurations, yielding a mean C-index of 0.861 ($\sigma=0.112$) on the internal 5-fold nested cross-validation framework, and a C-index of 0.7103 on the hold out data of CHIMERA 2025 c...

Abstract: This work proposes an evidence-retrieval mechanism for uncertainty-aware decision-making that replaces a single global cutoff with an evidence-conditioned, instance-adaptive criterion. For each test instance, proximal exemplars are retrieved in an embedding space; their predictive distributions are fused via Dempster-Shafer theory. The resulting fused belief acts as a per-instance thresholding mechanism. Because the supporting evidences are explicit, decisions are transparent and auditable. Experiments on CIFAR-10/100 with BiT and ViT backbones show higher or comparable uncertainty-aware performance with materially fewer confidently incorrect outcomes and a sustainable review load compared with applying threshold on prediction entropy. Notably, only a few evidences are sufficient to realize these gains; increasing the evidence set yields only modest changes. These results indicate that evid...
