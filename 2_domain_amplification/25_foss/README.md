# foss domain amplification

exploring free and open source software, decentralized systems, and p2p technologies

## subdomains
- `selfhosting/` - infrastructure optimization for your *arr suite and server
- `local_ai/` - self-hosted llms and cost-free inference systems
- `agentic_systems/` - autonomous agents for research and coding tasks
- `nostr/` - nostr protocol exploration for decentralized blog syndication
- `knowledge_systems/` - personal knowledge management and research tools
- `content_systems/` - blog infrastructure and publishing optimization
- `mesh_networks/` - p2p networking beyond your current tailscale setup
- `privacy_tools/` - digital privacy and security infrastructure

## focus areas
- decentralized protocols and networks
- censorship-resistant communication
- user sovereignty and data ownership
- p2p alternatives to centralized platforms
- foss alternatives to proprietary software

## philosophy
championing an internet built on open protocols, user control, and decentralized infrastructure rather than corporate silos
