        &lt;div&gt;&lt;p&gt;Python 3.14 introduces improvements to its interactive shell (REPL), bringing a more modern, colorful, and user-friendly environment. The new features make the Python 3.14 REPL a powerful tool for experimentation. Whether you’re testing a quick idea, exploring a new library, or debugging a tricky snippet, the REPL gives you instant feedback—no files, no setup, just type and run.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The default CPython REPL intentionally kept things minimal. It was fast, reliable, and available everywhere, but it lacked the richer, more ergonomic features found in tools like &lt;a href=&quot;https://realpython.com/ipython-interactive-python-shell/&quot;&gt;IPython&lt;/a&gt; or &lt;a href=&quot;https://realpython.com/ptpython-shell/&quot;&gt;ptpython&lt;/a&gt;. That began to change in &lt;strong&gt;Python 3.13&lt;/strong&gt;, when CPython adopted a modern PyREPL-based shell by default, adding multiline editing, better history navigation, and smarter &lt;span class=&quot;keys&quot;&gt;&lt;kbd class=&quot;key-tab&quot;&gt;Tab&lt;/kbd&gt;&lt;/span&gt; completion.&lt;/p&gt;

With marimo, you can seamlessly reproduce and share content while benefiting from automatic cell updates and a correct execution order. Discover how marimo&rsquo;s features make it an ideal tool for documenting research and learning activities. By the end of this video course, you&rsquo;ll understand that: marimo notebooks automatically update dependent cells, ensuring consistent results across your work. Reactivity allows marimo to determine the correct running order of cells using a directed acyclic graph (DAG). Sandboxing in marimo creates isolated environments for notebooks, preventing package conflicts and ensuring reproducibility. You can add interactivity to marimo notebooks with UI elements like sliders and radio buttons. Traditional linear notebooks have inherent flaws, such as hidden state issues, that marimo addresses wi...
