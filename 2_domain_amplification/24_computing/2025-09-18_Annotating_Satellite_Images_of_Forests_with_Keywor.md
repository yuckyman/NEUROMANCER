Annotating Satellite Images of Forests with Keywords from a Specialized Corpus in the Context of Change Detection

arXiv:2509.13586v1 Announce Type: new Abstract: The Amazon rain forest is a vital ecosystem that plays a crucial role in regulating the Earth's climate and providing habitat for countless species. Deforestation in the Amazon is a major concern as it has a significant impact on global carbon emissions and biodiversity. In this paper, we present a method for detecting deforestation in the Amazon using image pairs from Earth observation satellites. Our method leverages deep learning techniques to compare the images of the same area at different dates and identify changes in the forest cover. We also propose a visual semantic model that automatically annotates the detected changes with relevant keywords. The candidate annotation for images are extracted from scientific documents related to the Amazon region. We evaluate our approach on a dataset of Amazon image pairs and demonstrate its effectiveness in detecting deforestation and generating relevant annotations. Our method provides a usef...

      <title>Proximity-Based Evidence Retrieval for Uncertainty-Aware Neural Networks</title>

Abstract: This work proposes an evidence-retrieval mechanism for uncertainty-aware decision-making that replaces a single global cutoff with an evidence-conditioned, instance-adaptive criterion. For each test instance, proximal exemplars are retrieved in an embedding space; their predictive distributions are fused via Dempster-Shafer theory. The resulting fused belief acts as a per-instance thresholding mechanism. Because the supporting evidences are explicit, decisions are transparent and auditable. Experiments on CIFAR-10/100 with BiT and ViT backbones show higher or comparable uncertainty-aware performance with materially fewer confidently incorrect outcomes and a sustainable review load compared with applying threshold on prediction entropy. Notably, only a few evidences are sufficient to realize these gains; increasing the evidence set yields only modest changes. These results indicate that evid...
