This approach is closely aligned with the practice of agile software development, and the &#8220;build-measure-learn&#8221; process in the Lean Startup methodology, and can significantly reduce development costs and shorten the time-to-market. Rapid prototyping is especially useful for shipping successful AI products, given the early-stage nature of related technologies, use cases, and user expectations. To this end, Streamlit was launched in 2019 as a Python framework that simplifies the process of prototyping AI apps that require user interfaces (UIs). Data scientists and engineers can focus on the backend parts (e.g., training an ML model and exposing a prediction endpoint via an API), and with only a few lines of Python code, Streamlit can spin up a user-friendly, customizable UI. Chainlit, also a Python framework, was launched more recently in 2023 to specifically address pain points in prototyping conversational AI applications (i.e., chatbots). While Streamlit and Chainlit are similar in some ways, there are also important differences. In this article, we will examine the pros and cons of both frameworks by building end-to-end demo chatbot applications, and provide practical recommendations. Note:&nbsp;All figur...
