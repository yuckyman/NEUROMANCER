But this isn’t new. It also happened in the era of business intelligence, big data, data science, analytics, and machine learning. There were studies that pegged failure rates at 80-90%. That number isn’t likely to change. What leaders should be thinking about is how to be among the 10-20% winners. Why do most organizations fail? Because they are pulled in a thousand directions at once. Vendors sell point solutions that solve only a sliver of the problem.
