The views expressed in this article are my own. The data and examples presented are published with my employer’s permission and do not contain any confidential information. Introduction A store&#8217;s assortment is a complete and varied range of products sold to customers. It is subject to evolve based on various factors such as: economic conditions, consumer trends, profitability, quality or compliance issues, renewal of some product ranges, stock levels, seasonal changes, etc. When a product is no longer available on the store shelves, some of its sales may shift to other products. For a major food retailer like Carrefour, it is crucial to estimate this sales shift accurately to manage the risk of loss due to product unavailability and approximate the loss due to it. This measurement serves as an indicator of the consequences of the unavailability of a product. Additionally, it gradually builds a valuable history of sales shift impact estimates. Yet, estimating sales shifts is complex. Customer behavior — influenced by hard-to-predict emotional factors — seasonality of certain products, or introduction of new products can all affect sales shifts. In addition, many products become unavailable across all stores simultaneously, making it impossible to establish a control population. The Causal Impact synthetic control approach, developed by a Google team, fits the partic...
