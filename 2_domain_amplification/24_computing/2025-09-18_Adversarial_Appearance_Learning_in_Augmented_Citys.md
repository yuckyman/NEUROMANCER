# Adversarial Appearance Learning in Augmented Cityscapes for Pedestrian Recogn...

## summary
In this paper, we develop a pipeline using augmented Cityscapes to improve pedestrian recognition. We use virtual pedestrians with custom traffic scenarios to reduce domain gap and make the data more realistic for training pedestrian recognition models.

Adversarial Appearance Learning in Augmented Cityscapes for Pedestrian Recognition in Autonomous Driving

arXiv:2509.13507v1 Announce Type: new Abstract: In the autonomous driving area synthetic data is crucial for cover specific traffic scenarios which autonomous vehicle must handle. This data commonly introduces domain gap between synthetic and real domains. In this paper we deploy data augmentation to generate custom traffic scenarios with VRUs in order to improve pedestrian recognition. We provide a pipeline for augmentation of the Cityscapes dataset with virtual pedestrians. In order to improve augmentation realism of the pipeline we reveal a novel generative network architecture for adversarial learning of the data-set lighting conditions. We also evaluate our approach on the tasks of semantic and instance segmentation.

      <title>Proximity-Based Evidence Retrieval for Uncertainty-Aware Neural Networks</title>

Abstract: This work proposes an evidence-retrieval mechanism for uncertainty-aware decision-making that replaces a single global cutoff with an evidence-conditioned, instance-adaptive criterion. For each test instance, proximal exemplars are retrieved in an embedding space; their predictive distributions are fused via Dempster-Shafer theory. The resulting fused belief acts as a per-instance thresholding mechanism. Because the supporting evidences are explicit, decisions are transparent and auditable. Experiments on CIFAR-10/100 with BiT and ViT backbones show higher or comparable uncertainty-aware performance with materially fewer confidently incorrect outcomes and a sustainable review load compared with applying threshold on prediction entropy. Notably, only a few evidences are sufficient to realize these gains; increasing the evidence set yields only modest changes. These results indicate that evid...
