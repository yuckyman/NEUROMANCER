Morphology-optimized Multi-Scale Fusion: Combining Local Artifacts and Mesoscopic Semantics for Deepfake Detection and Localization

arXiv:2509.13776v1 Announce Type: new Abstract: While the pursuit of higher accuracy in deepfake detection remains a central goal, there is an increasing demand for precise localization of manipulated regions. Despite the remarkable progress made in classification-based detection, accurately localizing forged areas remains a significant challenge. A common strategy is to incorporate forged region annotations during model training alongside manipulated images. However, such approaches often neglect the complementary nature of local detail and global semantic context, resulting in suboptimal localization performance. Moreover, an often-overlooked aspect is the fusion strategy between local and global predictions. Naively combining the outputs from both branches can amplify noise and errors, thereby undermining the effectiveness of the localization. To address these issues, we propose a novel approach that independently predicts manipulated regions using both local and global perspectives...

      <title>Proximity-Based Evidence Retrieval for Uncertainty-Aware Neural Networks</title>

Abstract: This work proposes an evidence-retrieval mechanism for uncertainty-aware decision-making that replaces a single global cutoff with an evidence-conditioned, instance-adaptive criterion. For each test instance, proximal exemplars are retrieved in an embedding space; their predictive distributions are fused via Dempster-Shafer theory. The resulting fused belief acts as a per-instance thresholding mechanism. Because the supporting evidences are explicit, decisions are transparent and auditable. Experiments on CIFAR-10/100 with BiT and ViT backbones show higher or comparable uncertainty-aware performance with materially fewer confidently incorrect outcomes and a sustainable review load compared with applying threshold on prediction entropy. Notably, only a few evidences are sufficient to realize these gains; increasing the evidence set yields only modest changes. These results indicate that evid...
