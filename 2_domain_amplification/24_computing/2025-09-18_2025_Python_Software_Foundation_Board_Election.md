The 2025 PSF Board Election is Open!

The 2025 PSF Board Election is Open! The Python Software Foundation's annual board member election is taking place right now, with votes (from previously affirmed voting members) accepted from September 2nd, 2:00 pm UTC through Tuesday, September 16th, 2:00 pm UTC. I've served on the board since 2022 and I'm running for a second term. Here's the opening section of my nomination statement. Hi, I'm Simon Willison. I've been a board member of the Python Software Foundation since 2022 and I'm running for re-election in 2025. Last year I wrote a detailed article about Things I’ve learned serving on the board of the Python Software Foundation. I hope to continue learning and sharing what I've learned for a second three-year term. One of my goals for a second term is to help deepen the relationship between the AI research world and the Python Software Foundation. There is an enormous amount of value being created in the AI space using Python and I would like to see more of that value flow bac...

Anthropic had a very bad month in terms of model reliability:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Between August and early September, three infrastructure bugs intermittently degraded Claude's response quality. We've now resolved these issues and want to explain what happened. [...]&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To state it plainly: We never reduce model quality due to demand, time of day, or server load. The problems our users reported were due to infrastructure bugs alone. [...]&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We don't typically share this level of technical detail about our infrastructure, but the scope and complexity of these issues justified a more comprehensive explanation.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I'm really glad Anthropic are publishing this in so much detail. Their reputation for serving their models reliably has taken a notable hit.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I hadn't appreciated the additional complexity caused by their mixture of different serving platforms:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We deploy Claude across multiple hardwar...

I hope to continue learning and sharing what I've learned for a second three-year term. One of my goals for a second term is to help deepen the relationship between the AI research world and the Python Software Foundation. There is an enormous amount of value being created in the AI space using Python and I would like to see more of that value flow back into the rest of the Python ecosystem. I see the Python Package Index (PyPI) as one of the most impactful projects of the Python Software Foundation and plan to continue to advocate for further investment in the PyPI team and infrastructure. As a California resident I'm excited to see PyCon return to the West Coast, and I'm looking forward to getting involved in helping make PyCon 2026 and 2027 in Long Beach, California as successful as possible. I'm delighted to have been endorsed this year by Al Sweigart, Loren Crary and Christopher Neugebauer. If you are a voting member I hope I have earned your vote this year. You can watch video introductions from several of the other nominees in this six minute YouTube video and this playlist.
