# Task-Aware Image Signal Processor for Advanced Visual Perception

## summary
In this paper, we propose a compact RAW-to-RGB framework called Task-Aware Image Signal Processing (TA-ISP) that achieves efficient signal processing for visual perception tasks such as object detection and segmentation. The proposed method addresses the computational overhead and limitations of traditional ISP pipelines by utilizing task-aware information and optimizing the data transformations.

Task-Aware Image Signal Processor for Advanced Visual Perception

arXiv:2509.13762v1 Announce Type: new Abstract: In recent years, there has been a growing trend in computer vision towards exploiting RAW sensor data, which preserves richer information compared to conventional low-bit RGB images. Early studies mainly focused on enhancing visual quality, while more recent efforts aim to leverage the abundant information in RAW data to improve the performance of visual perception tasks such as object detection and segmentation. However, existing approaches still face two key limitations: large-scale ISP networks impose heavy computational overhead, while methods based on tuning traditional ISP pipelines are restricted by limited representational capacity.To address these issues, we propose Task-Aware Image Signal Processing (TA-ISP), a compact RAW-to-RGB framework that produces task-oriented representations for pretrained vision models. Instead of heavy dense convolutional pipelines, TA-ISP predicts a small set of lightweight, multi-scale modulation ope...

      <title>Proximity-Based Evidence Retrieval for Uncertainty-Aware Neural Networks</title>

Abstract: This work proposes an evidence-retrieval mechanism for uncertainty-aware decision-making that replaces a single global cutoff with an evidence-conditioned, instance-adaptive criterion. For each test instance, proximal exemplars are retrieved in an embedding space; their predictive distributions are fused via Dempster-Shafer theory. The resulting fused belief acts as a per-instance thresholding mechanism. Because the supporting evidences are explicit, decisions are transparent and auditable. Experiments on CIFAR-10/100 with BiT and ViT backbones show higher or comparable uncertainty-aware performance with materially fewer confidently incorrect outcomes and a sustainable review load compared with applying threshold on prediction entropy. Notably, only a few evidences are sufficient to realize these gains; increasing the evidence set yields only modest changes. These results indicate that evid...
