Generative Image Coding with Diffusion Prior

arXiv:2509.13768v1 Announce Type: new Abstract: As generative technologies advance, visual content has evolved into a complex mix of natural and AI-generated images, driving the need for more efficient coding techniques that prioritize perceptual quality. Traditional codecs and learned methods struggle to maintain subjective quality at high compression ratios, while existing generative approaches face challenges in visual fidelity and generalization. To this end, we propose a novel generative coding framework leveraging diffusion priors to enhance compression performance at low bitrates. Our approach employs a pre-optimized encoder to generate generalized compressed-domain representations, integrated with the pretrained model's internal features via a lightweight adapter and an attentive fusion module. This framework effectively leverages existing pretrained diffusion models and enables efficient adaptation to different pretrained models for new requirements with minimal retraining cos...

      <title>Proximity-Based Evidence Retrieval for Uncertainty-Aware Neural Networks</title>

Abstract: This work proposes an evidence-retrieval mechanism for uncertainty-aware decision-making that replaces a single global cutoff with an evidence-conditioned, instance-adaptive criterion. For each test instance, proximal exemplars are retrieved in an embedding space; their predictive distributions are fused via Dempster-Shafer theory. The resulting fused belief acts as a per-instance thresholding mechanism. Because the supporting evidences are explicit, decisions are transparent and auditable. Experiments on CIFAR-10/100 with BiT and ViT backbones show higher or comparable uncertainty-aware performance with materially fewer confidently incorrect outcomes and a sustainable review load compared with applying threshold on prediction entropy. Notably, only a few evidences are sufficient to realize these gains; increasing the evidence set yields only modest changes. These results indicate that evid...
