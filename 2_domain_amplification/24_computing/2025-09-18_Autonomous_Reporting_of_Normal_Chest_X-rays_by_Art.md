Autonomous Reporting of Normal Chest X-rays by Artificial Intelligence in the United Kingdom. Can We Take the Human Out of the Loop?

arXiv:2509.13428v1 Announce Type: cross Abstract: Chest X-rays (CXRs) are the most commonly performed imaging investigation. In the UK, many centres experience reporting delays due to radiologist workforce shortages. Artificial intelligence (AI) tools capable of distinguishing normal from abnormal CXRs have emerged as a potential solution. If normal CXRs could be safely identified and reported without human input, a substantial portion of radiology workload could be reduced. This article examines the feasibility and implications of autonomous AI reporting of normal CXRs. Key issues include defining normal, ensuring generalisability across populations, and managing the sensitivity-specificity trade-off. It also addresses legal and regulatory challenges, such as compliance with IR(ME)R and GDPR, and the lack accountability frameworks for errors. Further considerations include the impact on radiologists practice, the need for robust post-market surveillance, and incorporation of patient p...

      <title>Proximity-Based Evidence Retrieval for Uncertainty-Aware Neural Networks</title>

Abstract: This work proposes an evidence-retrieval mechanism for uncertainty-aware decision-making that replaces a single global cutoff with an evidence-conditioned, instance-adaptive criterion. For each test instance, proximal exemplars are retrieved in an embedding space; their predictive distributions are fused via Dempster-Shafer theory. The resulting fused belief acts as a per-instance thresholding mechanism. Because the supporting evidences are explicit, decisions are transparent and auditable. Experiments on CIFAR-10/100 with BiT and ViT backbones show higher or comparable uncertainty-aware performance with materially fewer confidently incorrect outcomes and a sustainable review load compared with applying threshold on prediction entropy. Notably, only a few evidences are sufficient to realize these gains; increasing the evidence set yields only modest changes. These results indicate that evid...
