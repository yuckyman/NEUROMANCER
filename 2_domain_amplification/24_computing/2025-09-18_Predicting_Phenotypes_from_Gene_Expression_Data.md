Self-supervised learning on gene expression data

arXiv:2507.13912v2 Announce Type: replace-cross Abstract: Predicting phenotypes from gene expression data is a crucial task in biomedical research, enabling insights into disease mechanisms, drug responses, and personalized medicine. Traditional machine learning and deep learning rely on supervised learning, which requires large quantities of labeled data that are costly and time-consuming to obtain in the case of gene expression data. Self-supervised learning has recently emerged as a promising approach to overcome these limitations by extracting information directly from the structure of unlabeled data. In this study, we investigate the application of state-of-the-art self-supervised learning methods to bulk gene expression data for phenotype prediction. We selected three self-supervised methods, based on different approaches, to assess their ability to exploit the inherent structure of the data and to generate qualitative representations which can be used for downstream predictive t...

      <title>Explicit Reasoning Makes Better Judges: A Systematic Study on Accuracy, Efficiency, and Robustness</title>

      <description>arXiv:2509.13332v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: As Large Language Models (LLMs) are increasingly adopted as automated judges in benchmarking and reward modeling, ensuring their reliability, efficiency, and robustness has become critical. In this work, we present a systematic comparison of "thinking" and "non-thinking" LLMs in the LLM-as-a-judge paradigm using open-source Qwen 3 models of relatively small sizes (0.6B, 1.7B, and 4B parameters). We evaluate both accuracy and computational efficiency (FLOPs) on RewardBench tasks, and further examine augmentation strategies for non-thinking models, including in-context learning, rubric-guided judging, reference-based evaluation, and n-best aggregation. Our results show that despite these enhancements, non-thinking models generally fall short of their thinking counterparts. Our results show that thinking models achieve approximately 10% points higher accuracy with lit...
