Do Large Language Models Understand Word Senses?

arXiv:2509.13905v1 Announce Type: cross Abstract: Understanding the meaning of words in context is a fundamental capability for Large Language Models (LLMs). Despite extensive evaluation efforts, the extent to which LLMs show evidence that they truly grasp word senses remains underexplored. In this paper, we address this gap by evaluating both i) the Word Sense Disambiguation (WSD) capabilities of instruction-tuned LLMs, comparing their performance to state-of-the-art systems specifically designed for the task, and ii) the ability of two top-performing open- and closed-source LLMs to understand word senses in three generative settings: definition generation, free-form explanation, and example generation. Notably, we find that, in the WSD task, leading models such as GPT-4o and DeepSeek-V3 achieve performance on par with specialized WSD systems, while also demonstrating greater robustness across domains and levels of difficulty. In the generation tasks, results reveal that LLMs can expl...

      <title>Explicit Reasoning Makes Better Judges: A Systematic Study on Accuracy, Efficiency, and Robustness</title>

Abstract: As Large Language Models (LLMs) are increasingly adopted as automated judges in benchmarking and reward modeling, ensuring their reliability, efficiency, and robustness has become critical. In this work, we present a systematic comparison of "thinking" and "non-thinking" LLMs in the LLM-as-a-judge paradigm using open-source Qwen 3 models of relatively small sizes (0.6B, 1.7B, and 4B parameters). We evaluate both accuracy and computational efficiency (FLOPs) on RewardBench tasks, and further examine augmentation strategies for non-thinking models, including in-context learning, rubric-guided judging, reference-based evaluation, and n-best aggregation. Our results show that despite these enhancements, non-thinking models generally fall short of their thinking counterparts. Our results show that thinking models achieve approximately 10% points higher accuracy with lit...
