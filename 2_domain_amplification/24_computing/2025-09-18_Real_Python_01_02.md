        &lt;div&gt;&lt;p&gt;Python 3.14 introduces improvements to its interactive shell (REPL), bringing a more modern, colorful, and user-friendly environment. The new features make the Python 3.14 REPL a powerful tool for experimentation. Whether you’re testing a quick idea, exploring a new library, or debugging a tricky snippet, the REPL gives you instant feedback—no files, no setup, just type and run.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The default CPython REPL intentionally kept things minimal. It was fast, reliable, and available everywhere, but it lacked the richer, more ergonomic features found in tools like &lt;a href=&quot;https://realpython.com/ipython-interactive-python-shell/&quot;&gt;IPython&lt;/a&gt; or &lt;a href=&quot;https://realpython.com/ptpython-shell/&quot;&gt;ptpython&lt;/a&gt;. That began to change in &lt;strong&gt;Python 3.13&lt;/strong&gt;, when CPython adopted a modern PyREPL-based shell by default, adding multiline editing, better history navigation, and smarter &lt;span class=&quot;keys&quot;&gt;&lt;kbd class=&quot;key-tab&quot;&gt;Tab&lt;/kbd&gt;&lt;/span&gt; completion.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;By the end of...

Before diving into any performance tuning, you should strongly consider using a technique called software profiling. It can help you decide whether optimizing the code is necessary and, if so, which parts of the code you should focus on. Sometimes, the return on investment in performance optimizations just isn&rsquo;t worth the effort. If you only run your code once or twice, or if it takes longer to improve the code than execute it, then what&rsquo;s the point? When it comes to improving the quality of your code, you&rsquo;ll probably optimize for performance as a final step, if you do it at all. Often, your code will become speedier and more memory efficient thanks to other changes that you make. When in doubt, go through this short checklist to figure out whether to work on performance: Testing: Have you tested your code to prove that it works as expected and without errors? Refactoring: Does your code need some cl...
