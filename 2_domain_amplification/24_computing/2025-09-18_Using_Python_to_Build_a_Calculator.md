Over time, these calculators evolved so that more people could use them. It was in the 1960s, that the first electronic calculator came into being, and as time went on, the calculator was integrated into our computers and now mobiles. Either physical or digital, we live in a time where each of us has used a calculator. Whether we are calculating rent, totalling the bill, or finding the final percentage of our kids&#8217; results, we all have taken help from the calculator. Let&#8217;s utilize Python basics, including functions, conditional statements, dictionaries, and loops, to create our version of a calculator. Working of our Calculator Our calculator will work as follows: It will ask the user for a number It will then ask the user for the operation It will ask the user for the second number It will perform its calculations and print the output It will ask the user if they want to carry on with this number (like our physical calculator) or start all over If the user asks to start all over, it will restart the above process If the user wants to carry on with the result, it will take this number as the first and ask for the operation, and then follow as the first time. Let us construct the above thought process into a flowchart for better understanding: Flowchart (Image by Author) Defining Operation Functions First of all, we will define functions th...
