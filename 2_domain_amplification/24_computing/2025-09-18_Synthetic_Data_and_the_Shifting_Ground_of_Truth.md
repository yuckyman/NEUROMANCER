# Synthetic Data and the Shifting Ground of Truth

## summary
Synthetic data for AI models can be used as training data, but it does not necessarily refer to external features. This article discusses the challenges and opportunities associated with synthetic data in machine learning.

Synthetic Data and the Shifting Ground of Truth

arXiv:2509.13355v1 Announce Type: cross Abstract: The emergence of synthetic data for privacy protection, training data generation, or simply convenient access to quasi-realistic data in any shape or volume complicates the concept of ground truth. Synthetic data mimic real-world observations, but do not refer to external features. This lack of a representational relationship, however, not prevent researchers from using synthetic data as training data for AI models and ground truth repositories. It is claimed that the lack of data realism is not merely an acceptable tradeoff, but often leads to better model performance than realistic data: compensate for known biases, prevent overfitting and support generalization, and make the models more robust in dealing with unexpected outliers. Indeed, injecting noisy and outright implausible data into training sets can be beneficial for the model. This greatly complicates usual assumptions based on which representational accuracy determines data f...

      <title>Explicit Reasoning Makes Better Judges: A Systematic Study on Accuracy, Efficiency, and Robustness</title>

      <description>arXiv:2509.13332v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: As Large Language Models (LLMs) are increasingly adopted as automated judges in benchmarking and reward modeling, ensuring their reliability, efficiency, and robustness has become critical. In this work, we present a systematic comparison of "thinking" and "non-thinking" LLMs in the LLM-as-a-judge paradigm using open-source Qwen 3 models of relatively small sizes (0.6B, 1.7B, and 4B parameters). We evaluate both accuracy and computational efficiency (FLOPs) on RewardBench tasks, and further examine augmentation strategies for non-thinking models, including in-context learning, rubric-guided judging, reference-based evaluation, and n-best aggregation. Our results show that despite these enhancements, non-thinking models generally fall short of their thinking counterparts. Our results show that thinking models achieve approximately 10% points higher accuracy with lit...

This greatly complicates usual assumptions based on which representational accuracy determines data fidelity (garbage in - garbage out). Furthermore, ground truth becomes a self-referential affair, in which the labels used as a ground truth repository are themselves synthetic products of a generative model and as such not connected t...
