# tldraw jupyter notebook integration spec

## overview

a hybrid jupyter notebook system that combines live local development with static deployment, using tldraw’s layering system for visual annotations and smooth playback animations for pre-rendered content.

## core concept

**the layering system keeps annotations separate from content**

tldraw’s architecture provides:

- background layer: notebook content (code, outputs, plots)
- annotation layer: drawings, text, arrows, visual connections
- ui layer: controls, menus, interaction elements

each layer maintains independent coordinate spaces and update cycles, allowing annotations to persist while content changes.

## architecture

### development vs deployment split

**local development mode:**

```
jupyter kernel <-- websocket --> tldraw canvas
     ^                               ^
     |                               |
   live code                   live annotations
```

**deployed static mode:**

```
notebook.json --> static renderer --> tldraw canvas (read-only)
                                           ^
                                           |
                                     saved annotations
```

### workflow

1. **develop locally** with live kernel connection
1. **annotations stored** in separate layer files (json)
1. **when ready:** `jupyter nbconvert` + annotation export
1. **push static assets** to github/cloudflare
1. **static site renders** notebook + overlays annotations

## file structure

```
project/
├── notebook.ipynb          # source notebook
├── annotations/            # tldraw shape data
│   ├── cell_1.json
│   ├── cell_2.json 
├── static/                 # generated for deployment
│   ├── notebook.json      # converted notebook
│   ├── annotations.json   # merged annotations
├── dev-server.py          # local jupyter connector
└── deploy/                # static site assets
```

## static deployment strategy

### option 1: pre-rendered with playback (chosen approach)

- all outputs already computed and stored in notebook.json
- “run” button reveals stored output with animations
- simulates typing/streaming for long outputs
- feels interactive but totally static
- completely self-contained (no external dependencies)

### animation system

**output types & animations:**

```javascript
// text/plain - typewriter effect
streamText(content, speed=50) // chars per second

// plots - fade in with scaling
animatePlot(imageData) // smooth scale + opacity

// dataframes - row by row reveal
streamDataFrame(df) // progressive table population

// stdout - real-time feel
streamOutput(lines) // line by line with cursor
```

**timing metadata:**
capture execution timing during local development:

```json
{
  "cell_execution": {
    "start_time": 1.2,
    "output_delay": 0.8,  // delay before first output
    "stream_chunks": [    // for streaming text
      {"delay": 0.0, "content": "calculating..."},
      {"delay": 2.1, "content": "result: 42"}
    ]
  }
}
```

**tldraw integration:**

- annotations animate in sync with code execution
- arrows appear pointing to outputs as they render
- text callouts fade in after plots complete
- intersection observer triggers animations on scroll

## implementation phases

### phase 1: basic proof of concept

- html page with tldraw canvas
- load sample notebook.json
- implement typewriter effect for one cell
- add smooth plot reveal

### phase 2: full animation system

- all output types (text, plots, dataframes, errors)
- timing metadata capture during development
- synchronized annotation reveals

### phase 3: local development integration

- jupyter kernel websocket connection
- live code execution with annotation overlay
- export pipeline to static format

### phase 4: deployment optimization

- static site generation
- github/cloudflare integration
- annotation version control

## key benefits

**for development:**

- live coding with visual annotation capabilities
- collaborative editing through tldraw’s real-time features
- familiar jupyter environment enhanced with canvas interactions

**for deployment:**

- completely static, no server required
- version controlled visual annotations
- smooth, engaging presentation of analysis
- works offline, no external dependencies

**for collaboration:**

- annotations stored as json, diffable in git
- visual layer separate from code logic
- can replay analysis with annotations intact

## technical considerations

**serialization:** tldraw’s store serializes perfectly to json, enabling version control of visual annotations alongside code

**coordinate persistence:** annotations maintain position even as cells shift during development

**offline capability:** static deployment works completely offline, supporting the foss/prepper philosophy

**performance:** layered rendering allows smooth interactions even with complex notebooks

## next steps

1. create initial project structure
1. implement basic typewriter effect
1. add tldraw canvas integration
1. build smooth plot animation system
1. develop local jupyter connector
1. create export pipeline for static deployment
