Rich Vehicle Routing Problem in Disaster Management enabling Temporally-causal Transhipments across Multi-Modal Transportation Network

arXiv:2509.13227v2 Announce Type: replace-cross Abstract: A rich vehicle routing problem is considered, allowing multiple trips of heterogeneous vehicles stationed at geographically distributed vehicle depots having access to different modes of transportation. The problem arises from the real-world requirement of optimizing the disaster response time by minimizing the makespan of vehicular routes. Multiple diversely-functional vertices are considered, including Transhipment Ports as inter-modal resource transfer stations. Both simultaneous and split pickup and delivery are considered, for multiple cargo types, along with Vehicle-Cargo and Transhipment Port-Cargo compatibilities. The superiority of the proposed cascaded minimization approach is demonstrated over the existing makespan minimization approaches through our developed Mixed-Integer Linear Programming formulation. To solve the problem quickly for practical implementation in a Disaster Management-specific Decision Support Syste...

      <title>Explicit Reasoning Makes Better Judges: A Systematic Study on Accuracy, Efficiency, and Robustness</title>

      <description>arXiv:2509.13332v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: As Large Language Models (LLMs) are increasingly adopted as automated judges in benchmarking and reward modeling, ensuring their reliability, efficiency, and robustness has become critical. In this work, we present a systematic comparison of "thinking" and "non-thinking" LLMs in the LLM-as-a-judge paradigm using open-source Qwen 3 models of relatively small sizes (0.6B, 1.7B, and 4B parameters). We evaluate both accuracy and computational efficiency (FLOPs) on RewardBench tasks, and further examine augmentation strategies for non-thinking models, including in-context learning, rubric-guided judging, reference-based evaluation, and n-best aggregation. Our results show that despite these enhancements, non-thinking models generally fall short of their thinking counterparts. Our results show that thinking models achieve approximately 10% points higher accuracy with lit...
