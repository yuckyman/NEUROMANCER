Explainable AI-Enhanced Supervisory Control for High-Precision Spacecraft Formation

arXiv:2509.13331v1 Announce Type: cross Abstract: We use artificial intelligence (AI) and supervisory adaptive control systems to plan and optimize the mission of precise spacecraft formation. Machine learning and robust control enhance the efficiency of spacecraft precision formation of the Virtual Telescope for X-ray Observation (VTXO) space mission. VTXO is a precise formation of two separate spacecraft making a virtual telescope with a one-kilometer focal length. One spacecraft carries the lens and the other spacecraft holds the camera to observe high-energy space objects in the X-ray domain with 55 milli-arcsecond angular resolution accuracy. Timed automata for supervisory control, Monte Carlo simulations for stability and robustness evaluation, and integration of deep neural networks for optimal estimation of mission parameters, satisfy the high precision mission criteria. We integrate deep neural networks with a constrained, non-convex dynamic optimization pipeline to predict op...

      <title>Explicit Reasoning Makes Better Judges: A Systematic Study on Accuracy, Efficiency, and Robustness</title>

Abstract: As Large Language Models (LLMs) are increasingly adopted as automated judges in benchmarking and reward modeling, ensuring their reliability, efficiency, and robustness has become critical. In this work, we present a systematic comparison of "thinking" and "non-thinking" LLMs in the LLM-as-a-judge paradigm using open-source Qwen 3 models of relatively small sizes (0.6B, 1.7B, and 4B parameters). We evaluate both accuracy and computational efficiency (FLOPs) on RewardBench tasks, and further examine augmentation strategies for non-thinking models, including in-context learning, rubric-guided judging, reference-based evaluation, and n-best aggregation. Our results show that despite these enhancements, non-thinking models generally fall short of their thinking counterparts. Our results show that thinking models achieve approximately 10% points higher accuracy with lit...
