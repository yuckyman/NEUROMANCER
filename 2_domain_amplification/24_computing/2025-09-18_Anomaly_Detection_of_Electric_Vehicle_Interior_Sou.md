A Domain Knowledge Informed Approach for Anomaly Detection of Electric Vehicle Interior Sounds

arXiv:2509.13390v1 Announce Type: cross Abstract: The detection of anomalies in automotive cabin sounds is critical for ensuring vehicle quality and maintaining passenger comfort. In many real-world settings, this task is more appropriately framed as an unsupervised learning problem rather than the supervised case due to the scarcity or complete absence of labeled faulty data. In such an unsupervised setting, the model is trained exclusively on healthy samples and detects anomalies as deviations from normal behavior. However, in the absence of labeled faulty samples for validation and the limited reliability of commonly used metrics, such as validation reconstruction error, effective model selection remains a significant challenge. To overcome these limitations, a domain-knowledge-informed approach for model selection is proposed, in which proxy-anomalies engineered through structured perturbations of healthy spectrograms are used in the validation set to support model selection. The p...

      <title>Proximity-Based Evidence Retrieval for Uncertainty-Aware Neural Networks</title>

Abstract: This work proposes an evidence-retrieval mechanism for uncertainty-aware decision-making that replaces a single global cutoff with an evidence-conditioned, instance-adaptive criterion. For each test instance, proximal exemplars are retrieved in an embedding space; their predictive distributions are fused via Dempster-Shafer theory. The resulting fused belief acts as a per-instance thresholding mechanism. Because the supporting evidences are explicit, decisions are transparent and auditable. Experiments on CIFAR-10/100 with BiT and ViT backbones show higher or comparable uncertainty-aware performance with materially fewer confidently incorrect outcomes and a sustainable review load compared with applying threshold on prediction entropy. Notably, only a few evidences are sufficient to realize these gains; increasing the evidence set yields only modest changes. These results indicate that evid...
