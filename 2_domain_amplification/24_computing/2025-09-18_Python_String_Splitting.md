The new features make the Python 3.14 REPL a powerful tool for experimentation. Whether you’re testing a quick idea, exploring a new library, or debugging a tricky snippet, the REPL gives you instant feedback—no files, no setup, just type and run.&lt;/p&gt;

That began to change in &lt;strong&gt;Python 3.13&lt;/strong&gt;, when CPython adopted a modern PyREPL-based shell by default, adding multiline editing, better history navigation, and smarter &lt;span class=&quot;keys&quot;&gt;&lt;kbd class=&quot;key-tab&quot;&gt;Tab&lt;/kbd&gt;&lt;/span&gt; completion.&lt;/p&gt;
