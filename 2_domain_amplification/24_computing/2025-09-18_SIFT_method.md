The SIFT method

The SIFT method The SIFT method is "an evaluation strategy developed by digital literacy expert, Mike Caulfield, to help determine whether online content can be trusted for credible or reliable sources of information." This looks extremely useful as a framework for helping people more effectively consume information online (increasingly gathered with the help of LLMs). Stop. "Be aware of your emotional response to the headline or information in the article" to protect against clickbait, and don't read further or share until you've applied the other three steps. Investigate the Source. Apply lateral reading, checking what others say about the source rather than just trusting their "about" page. Find Better Coverage. "Use lateral reading to see if you can find other sources corroborating the same information or disputing it" and consult trusted fact checkers if necessary. Trace Claims, Quotes, and Media to their Original Context. Try to find the original report or referenced material to ...

Anthropic had a very bad month in terms of model reliability:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Between August and early September, three infrastructure bugs intermittently degraded Claude's response quality. We've now resolved these issues and want to explain what happened. [...]&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To state it plainly: We never reduce model quality due to demand, time of day, or server load. The problems our users reported were due to infrastructure bugs alone. [...]&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We don't typically share this level of technical detail about our infrastructure, but the scope and complexity of these issues justified a more comprehensive explanation.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I'm really glad Anthropic are publishing this in so much detail. Their reputation for serving their models reliably has taken a notable hit.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I hadn't appreciated the additional complexity caused by their mixture of different serving platforms:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We deploy Claude across multiple hardwar...

This framework really resonates with me: it formally captures and improves on a bunch of informal techniques I've tried to apply in my own work.
