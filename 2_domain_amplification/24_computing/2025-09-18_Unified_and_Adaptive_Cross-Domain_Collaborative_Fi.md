# Unified and Adaptive Cross-Domain Collaborative Filtering via Graph Signal Pr...

## summary
This work proposes a unified and adaptive CDR framework based on graph signal processing, aiming to overcome challenges such as data sparsity, cold-start problems in domain adaptation, and address domain sensitivity issues. It features intra-domain collaboration while accommodating the inter-domain differences.

Towards Unified and Adaptive Cross-Domain Collaborative Filtering via Graph Signal Processing

arXiv:2407.12374v3 Announce Type: replace-cross Abstract: Collaborative Filtering (CF) is a foundational approach in recommender systems, but it struggles with challenges such as data sparsity and the cold-start problem. Cross-Domain Recommendation (CDR) has emerged as a promising solution by leveraging dense domains to improve recommendations in sparse target domains. However, existing CDR methods face significant limitations, including their reliance on overlapping users as a bridge between domains and their inability to address domain sensitivity, i.e., differences in user behaviors and characteristics across domains, effectively. To overcome these limitations, we propose CGSP, a unified and adaptive CDR framework based on graph signal processing (GSP). CGSP supports both intra-domain and inter-domain recommendations while adaptively controlling the influence of the source domain through a simple hyperparameter. The framework constructs a cross-domain similarity graph by integrating...

      <title>Explicit Reasoning Makes Better Judges: A Systematic Study on Accuracy, Efficiency, and Robustness</title>

Abstract: As Large Language Models (LLMs) are increasingly adopted as automated judges in benchmarking and reward modeling, ensuring their reliability, efficiency, and robustness has become critical. In this work, we present a systematic comparison of "thinking" and "non-thinking" LLMs in the LLM-as-a-judge paradigm using open-source Qwen 3 models of relatively small sizes (0.6B, 1.7B, and 4B parameters). We evaluate both accuracy and computational efficiency (FLOPs) on RewardBench tasks, and further examine augmentation strategies for non-thinking models, including in-context learning, rubric-guided judging, reference-based evaluation, and n-best aggregation. Our results show that despite these enhancements, non-thinking models generally fall short of their thinking counterparts. Our results show that thinking models achieve approximately 10% points higher accuracy with lit...
