        &lt;div&gt;&lt;p&gt;Python 3.14 introduces improvements to its interactive shell (REPL), bringing a more modern, colorful, and user-friendly environment. The new features make the Python 3.14 REPL a powerful tool for experimentation. Whether you’re testing a quick idea, exploring a new library, or debugging a tricky snippet, the REPL gives you instant feedback—no files, no setup, just type and run.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The default CPython REPL intentionally kept things minimal. It was fast, reliable, and available everywhere, but it lacked the richer, more ergonomic features found in tools like &lt;a href=&quot;https://realpython.com/ipython-interactive-python-shell/&quot;&gt;IPython&lt;/a&gt; or &lt;a href=&quot;https://realpython.com/ptpython-shell/&quot;&gt;ptpython&lt;/a&gt;. That began to change in &lt;strong&gt;Python 3.13&lt;/strong&gt;, when CPython adopted a modern PyREPL-based shell by default, adding multiline editing, better history navigation, and smarter &lt;span class=&quot;keys&quot;&gt;&lt;kbd class=&quot;key-tab&quot;&gt;Tab&lt;/kbd&gt;&lt;/span&gt; completion.&lt;/p&gt;

This week on the show, we talk with Travis Oliphant about his work on SciPy, NumPy, Numba, and many other contributions to the Python scientific community. Episode Sponsor: Travis discusses his initial involvement in the open-source community and how he discovered Python while working in biomedical imaging. He was trying to find ways to manage large sets of numerical data, which led to his initial contributions and collaborations in building scientific libraries. His appearance on the show coincides with the release of the Python documentary, in which he&rsquo;s featured. We discuss the myriad organizations Travis founded, including Quansight, OpenTeams, and Anaconda. We dig into his underlying missi...
