# GPT-5 Thinking in ChatGPT (Research Goblin)

## summary
GPT-5 is a significantly improved version of the popular ChatGPT model, designed specifically for generating research and data-related text. It can quickly search the internet for information and answer queries, making it ideal for tasks such as summarizing research papers or providing quick access to relevant articles.

GPT-5 Thinking in ChatGPT (aka Research Goblin) is shockingly good at search

"Don't use chatbots as search engines" was great advice for several years... until it wasn't. I wrote about how good OpenAI's o3 was at using its Bing-backed search tool back in April. GPT-5 feels even better. I've started calling it my Research Goblin. I can assign a task to it, no matter how trivial or complex, and it will do an often unreasonable amount of work to search the internet and figure out an answer. This is excellent for satisfying curiosity, and occasionally useful for more important endeavors as well. I always run my searches by selecting the "GPT-5 Thinking" model from the model picker - in my experience this leads to far more comprehensive (albeit much slower) results. Here are some examples from just the last couple of days. Every single one of them was run on my phone, usually while I was doing something else. Most of them were dictated using the iPhone voice keyboard, which I find faster than typing. Plus, it's fun to talk to my Research Goblin. Bouncy travelators I...

Anthropic had a very bad month in terms of model reliability:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Between August and early September, three infrastructure bugs intermittently degraded Claude's response quality. We've now resolved these issues and want to explain what happened. [...]&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To state it plainly: We never reduce model quality due to demand, time of day, or server load. The problems our users reported were due to infrastructure bugs alone. [...]&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We don't typically share this level of technical detail about our infrastructure, but the scope and complexity of these issues justified a more comprehensive explanation.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I'm really glad Anthropic are publishing this in so much detail. Their reputation for serving their models reliably has taken a notable hit.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I hadn't appreciated the additional complexity caused by their mixture of different serving platforms:&lt;/p&gt;
