Synthetic Data Generation for Screen Time and App Usage

arXiv:2509.13892v1 Announce Type: cross Abstract: Smartphone usage data can provide valuable insights for understanding interaction with technology and human behavior. However, collecting large-scale, in-the-wild smartphone usage logs is challenging due to high costs, privacy concerns, under representative user samples and biases like non-response that can skew results. These challenges call for exploring alternative approaches to obtain smartphone usage datasets. In this context, large language models (LLMs) such as Open AI's ChatGPT present a novel approach for synthetic smartphone usage data generation, addressing limitations of real-world data collection. We describe a case study on how four prompt strategies influenced the quality of generated smartphone usage data. We contribute with insights on prompt design and measures of data quality, reporting a prompting strategy comparison combining two factors, prompt level of detail (describing a user persona, describing the expected res...

      <title>Explicit Reasoning Makes Better Judges: A Systematic Study on Accuracy, Efficiency, and Robustness</title>

      <description>arXiv:2509.13332v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: As Large Language Models (LLMs) are increasingly adopted as automated judges in benchmarking and reward modeling, ensuring their reliability, efficiency, and robustness has become critical. In this work, we present a systematic comparison of "thinking" and "non-thinking" LLMs in the LLM-as-a-judge paradigm using open-source Qwen 3 models of relatively small sizes (0.6B, 1.7B, and 4B parameters). We evaluate both accuracy and computational efficiency (FLOPs) on RewardBench tasks, and further examine augmentation strategies for non-thinking models, including in-context learning, rubric-guided judging, reference-based evaluation, and n-best aggregation. Our results show that despite these enhancements, non-thinking models generally fall short of their thinking counterparts. Our results show that thinking models achieve approximately 10% points higher accuracy with lit...

We contribute with insights on prompt design and measures of data quality, reporting a prompting strategy comparison combining two factors, prompt level of detail (describing a user persona, describing the expected results characteristics) and seed data inclusion (with versus without an initial real usage example). Our findings suggest that using LLMs to generate structu...
