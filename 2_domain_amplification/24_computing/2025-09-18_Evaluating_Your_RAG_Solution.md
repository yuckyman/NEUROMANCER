Alex Davis Sep 17, 2025 15 min read Share Image by Author Introduction Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) solutions are everywhere. Over the past few years, we have seen them grow rapidly as organizations use RAG or hybrid-RAG solutions in customer service, healthcare, intelligence, and more. But how do we evaluate these solutions? And what methods can we use to determine the strengths and weaknesses of our RAG models? This article will give an introduction to RAG by building our own chatbot with open-source research data using LangChain and more. We will also leverage DeepEval to evaluate our RAG pipeline for both our retriever and generator. Lastly, we will discuss methods for human-testing RAG solutions. Retrieval-Augmented Generation With the emergence of LLMs, lots of criticisms were raised when these &#8220;base&#8221; pre-trained models would give incorrect answers, despite being trained on massive datasets. With that came Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG), a combination of search and generation capabilities that reference context-specific information before generating a response. Image by Author RAG has become very popular over the last few years due to its ability to reduce hallucinations and improve factuality. They are flexible, easy to update, and much cheaper than fine-tuning LLMs. We come across RAG solutions on a daily basis now. For example, many organizations have leveraged RAG to build internal chatbots for employees to navigate their knowledge base, and external chatbots to support customer service and other business functions.
