Gonçalves Sep 14, 2025 15 min read Share São Vicente, Madeira. Image by Author. In my last article [1], I threw out a lot of ideas centered around building structured graphs, mainly focused on descriptive or unsupervised exploration of data through graph structures. However, when we use graph features to improve our models, the temporal nature of the data must be taken into account. If we want to avoid undesired effects, we need to be careful not to leak future information into our training process. This means our graph (and the features derived from it) must be constructed in a time-aware, incremental way. Data leakage is such a paradoxical problem that a 2023 study by Sayash Kapoor and Arvind Narayanan [2] found that, up to that moment, it had affected 294 research papers across 17 scientific fields. They classify the types of data leakages ranging from textbook errors to open research problems.&nbsp; The issue is that during prototyping, results often seem very promising when they are really not. Most of the time, people do not realize this until models are deployed in production, wasting the time and resources of an entire team. Then, performance usually falls short of expectations without understanding why. This issue can become the Achilles’ heel that undermines all business AI initiatives.&nbsp; &#8230; ML-base&nbsp;leakage Data leakage occurs when the training data contains information about the output that won’t be available during inference. This causes overly optimistic evaluation metrics during development, creating misleading expectati...
