# 30_repos

This directory contains external repositories for research and development purposes.

The actual repository contents are excluded from version control via `.gitignore` to keep the main repository clean while ensuring this directory structure is preserved.

## Usage

Clone repositories into subdirectories here for local development and experimentation.

## Automation Note

This directory was moved from the root level to `3_projects/30_repos/` on 2025-09-16 to follow the johnny decimal organization system properly. External repositories are managed separately from the core neuromancer knowledge system.
