# neuromancer
## your digital brain's other half

yo, welcome to neuromancer - the processing side of my brain that pairs with wintermute.

### the vibe
```
wintermute (storage) ↔ neuromancer (thinking)
```

### how we're organized (johnny decimal style)

- **0_admin/** - all the backend stuff and configs
- **1_life/** - personal stuff, habits, keeping track of irl things
- **2_domain_amplification/** - knowledge areas and learning deep dives
- **3_projects/** - active work, code stuff, creative projects
- **4_people/** - friends, contacts, networking fr
- **5_collections/** - cool stuff you've saved and curated
- **6_academia/** - school/research vibes
- **7_travel/** - places to go, trip planning
- **8_media/** - what you're watching/reading/consuming
- **9_archive/** - old stuff that's still lowkey important

### what neuromancer does
basically the thinking half while wintermute handles storage:
- finds patterns in your notes (it hits different)
- makes connections you might miss
- automates the boring organizational stuff
- helps you actually process all that information
- **automated inbox processing**: phone shortcuts → AI-tagged markdown (every 10 mins)

### key automation
- **inbox processor**: `/0_admin/07_scripts/process_inbox.py`
  - processes text files from phone shortcuts automatically
  - AI tagging via ollama qwen2.5:0.5b (memory-efficient)
  - generates obsidian-compliant yaml frontmatter
  - cron job runs every 10 minutes
- **folder structure**: moved external repos to `3_projects/30_repos/`
- **processing flow**: `01_inbox/*.txt` → ollama analysis → `1_ideas/*.md`

### tech stack evolution
- **AI model**: qwen2.5:0.5b (397MB footprint, A/B tested vs smollm2)
- **automation**: python + cron for continuous processing
- **memory optimization**: 30s timeouts, efficient prompting
- **error handling**: fallback metadata if AI processing fails
