# neuromancer
## your digital brain's other half

yo, welcome to neuromancer - the processing side of my brain that pairs with wintermute.

### the vibe
```
wintermute (storage) â†” neuromancer (thinking)
```

### how we're organized (johnny decimal style)

- **0_admin/** - all the backend stuff and configs
- **1_life/** - personal stuff, habits, keeping track of irl things
- **2_domain_amplification/** - knowledge areas and learning deep dives
- **3_projects/** - active work, code stuff, creative projects
- **4_people/** - friends, contacts, networking fr
- **5_collections/** - cool stuff you've saved and curated
- **6_academia/** - school/research vibes
- **7_travel/** - places to go, trip planning
- **8_media/** - what you're watching/reading/consuming
- **9_archive/** - old stuff that's still lowkey important

### what neuromancer does
basically the thinking half while wintermute handles storage:
- finds patterns in your notes (it hits different)
- makes connections you might miss
- automates the boring organizational stuff
- helps you actually process all that information
