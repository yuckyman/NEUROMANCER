# dev log - 2025-09-18

## what we worked on
- Added gitquick alias to .bashrc for quick git commits
- Created gitquick.sh script in 0_admin/07_scripts/ that dynamically generates commit messages with date and changed files
- Discussed embedding model uses in Obsidian vault and their limitations

## discoveries/insights
- Embedding models can enhance semantic search and note linking in Obsidian
- Small models (500M params) have limited domain understanding and are not easily mutable
- Need consistent AI agent behavior across different tools (Cursor, Claude Code, OpenCode)

## user preferences noted
- Prefers dynamic commit messages with context
- Wants unified NEUROMANCER philosophy across AI agents

## next session goals
- Define NEUROMANCER design philosophy and behavior guidelines
- Update AGENTS.md with consistent structure
- Explore embedding model integration options
