# neuromancer structure guide

## johnny decimal system but make it chill

### areas (0-9)
each number is like a different room in your brain:

| area | name | what it's for |
|------|------|---------------|
| 0 | admin | boring but necessary system stuff |
| 1 | life | personal management, health, habits |
| 2 | domain_amplification | knowledge domains, learning rabbit holes |
| 3 | projects | active work, coding, creative stuff |
| 4 | people | relationships, contacts, social network |
| 5 | collections | curated content, media you've saved |
| 6 | academia | education, research, formal learning |
| 7 | travel | places, planning, experiences |
| 8 | media | tracking what you consume |
| 9 | archive | old stuff you can't delete but don't use |

### categories (00-09, 10-19, etc.)
each area has 10 categories max - keeps things from getting too chaotic

### items (individual files)
the actual notes/files within categories

## file naming that doesn't suck
- lowercase with underscores (no_weird_CamelCase)
- dates when it matters (yyyy-mm-dd format)
- be descriptive but not essay-length
- stay consistent within each category

- complementary vibes, not competing
