SSL-SSAW: Self-Supervised Learning with Sigmoid Self-Attention Weighting for Question-Based Sign Language Translation

arXiv:2509.14036v1 Announce Type: cross Abstract: Sign Language Translation (SLT) bridges the communication gap between deaf people and hearing people, where dialogue provides crucial contextual cues to aid in translation. Building on this foundational concept, this paper proposes Question-based Sign Language Translation (QB-SLT), a novel task that explores the efficient integration of dialogue. Unlike gloss (sign language transcription) annotations, dialogue naturally occurs in communication and is easier to annotate. The key challenge lies in aligning multimodality features while leveraging the context of the question to improve translation. To address this issue, we propose a cross-modality Self-supervised Learning with Sigmoid Self-attention Weighting (SSL-SSAW) fusion method for sign language translation. Specifically, we employ contrastive learning to align multimodality features in QB-SLT, then introduce a Sigmoid Self-attention Weighting (SSAW) module for adaptive feature extra...
