A Visual Guide to Tuning Gradient Boosted Trees

Introduction My previous posts looked at the bog-standard decision tree and the wonder of a random forest. Now, to complete the triplet, I’ll visually explore gradient boosted trees! There are a bunch of gradient boosted tree libraries, including XGBoost, CatBoost, and LightGBM. However, for this I’m going to use sklearn’s one. Why? Simply because, compared [&#8230;] The post A Visual Guide to Tuning Gradient Boosted Trees appeared first on Towards Data Science.
