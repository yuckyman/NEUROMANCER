Gaussian Alignment for Relative Camera Pose Estimation via Single-View Reconstruction

arXiv:2509.13652v1 Announce Type: new Abstract: Estimating metric relative camera pose from a pair of images is of great importance for 3D reconstruction and localisation. However, conventional two-view pose estimation methods are not metric, with camera translation known only up to a scale, and struggle with wide baselines and textureless or reflective surfaces. This paper introduces GARPS, a training-free framework that casts this problem as the direct alignment of two independently reconstructed 3D scenes. GARPS leverages a metric monocular depth estimator and a Gaussian scene reconstructor to obtain a metric 3D Gaussian Mixture Model (GMM) for each image. It then refines an initial pose from a feed-forward two-view pose estimator by optimising a differentiable GMM alignment objective. This objective jointly considers geometric structure, view-independent colour, anisotropic covariance, and semantic feature consistency, and is robust to occlusions and texture-poor regions without re...
