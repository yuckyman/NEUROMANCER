# neuromancer dev log
## creating autobiographical memory

### 2025-09-12 - initial setup

**user preferences discovered:**
- lowercase, casual writing style
- gen-z slang (tasteful amounts)
- down-to-earth communication
- organic growth over rigid structure
- johnny decimal system as framework but let it evolve naturally
- autobiographical memory approach to track development

**what we built today:**
- basic neuromancer structure as wintermute's processing partner
- minimal folder setup (0_admin with 00_index and 01_inbox only)
- concept: wintermute = storage brain, neuromancer = thinking brain
- removed over-engineered folder structure, going for organic growth instead
- started this dev log as continuous memory system

**ian's vision:**
- neuromancer as digital hemisphere partnered with wintermute obsidian vault
- gibson-inspired naming (wintermute ↔ neuromancer)
- practical knowledge management with ai processing
- autobiographical tracking through dev logs

### github integration plan
- initialized neuromancer as git repo to track brain evolution
- creating 3_projects/repos/ to host user's github projects locally
- this gives ai direct access to modify/fix code
- repos excluded from main neuromancer git tracking (separate management)

**identified user repos:**
- bucket (rss/url pipeline) - recent, active
- spillyourgutsonline-gutterball (gutterball blog) - private, active  
- neural-nets_project, machine_vision_project - ai/ml work
- discord-buddy (habit tracker) - interesting gamification
- immich-swiper (tinder for photos) - creative project
- multimodal (reading project) - academic work

### repos cloned (2025-09-12)
successfully cloned key repositories to 3_projects/repos/:
- ✅ bucket - rss/url pipeline project (active)
- ✅ neural-nets_project - ai/ml work 
- ✅ discord-buddy - habit tracker with gamification
- ⚠️ immich-swiper - empty repo (placeholder?)

**setup complete:**
- neuromancer initialized as git repo
- repos structure created with .gitignore exclusions
- local access to user's code for ai modification/assistance
- autobiographical memory system active via dev log

**next steps:**
- make initial neuromancer commit
- establish sync workflows  
- build processing capabilities
- explore cloned codebases to understand patterns
