Invisible Yet Detected: PelFANet with Attention-Guided Anatomical Fusion for Pelvic Fracture Diagnosis

arXiv:2509.13873v1 Announce Type: new Abstract: Pelvic fractures pose significant diagnostic challenges, particularly in cases where fracture signs are subtle or invisible on standard radiographs. To address this, we introduce PelFANet, a dual-stream attention network that fuses raw pelvic X-rays with segmented bone images to improve fracture classification. The network em-ploys Fused Attention Blocks (FABlocks) to iteratively exchange and refine fea-tures from both inputs, capturing global context and localized anatomical detail. Trained in a two-stage pipeline with a segmentation-guided approach, PelFANet demonstrates superior performance over conventional methods. On the AMERI dataset, it achieves 88.68% accuracy and 0.9334 AUC on visible fractures, while generalizing effectively to invisible fracture cases with 82.29% accuracy and 0.8688 AUC, despite not being trained on them. These results highlight the clini-cal potential of anatomy-aware dual-input architectures for robust fract...
