Cross-Distribution Diffusion Priors-Driven Iterative Reconstruction for Sparse-View CT

arXiv:2509.13576v1 Announce Type: cross Abstract: Sparse-View CT (SVCT) reconstruction enhances temporal resolution and reduces radiation dose, yet its clinical use is hindered by artifacts due to view reduction and domain shifts from scanner, protocol, or anatomical variations, leading to performance degradation in out-of-distribution (OOD) scenarios. In this work, we propose a Cross-Distribution Diffusion Priors-Driven Iterative Reconstruction (CDPIR) framework to tackle the OOD problem in SVCT. CDPIR integrates cross-distribution diffusion priors, derived from a Scalable Interpolant Transformer (SiT), with model-based iterative reconstruction methods. Specifically, we train a SiT backbone, an extension of the Diffusion Transformer (DiT) architecture, to establish a unified stochastic interpolant framework, leveraging Classifier-Free Guidance (CFG) across multiple datasets. By randomly dropping the conditioning with a null embedding during training, the model learns both domain-speci...
