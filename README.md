# neuromancer
## the thinking half of your digital brain

**neuromancer** is basically the analytical side that pairs with your **wintermute** obsidian vault. think of it like having two brain hemispheres but digital (gibson would be proud).

## the setup

```
wintermute          ←→          neuromancer
(storage brain)                 (processing brain)
- keeps everything             - analyzes patterns
- reference materials          - makes connections  
- structured notes            - synthesizes info
- static organization         - active thinking
```

## how it's organized

starting minimal with johnny decimal framework - folders grow organically as needed:

- **0_admin/** - system stuff, dev logs, configs
  - **00_index/** - main documentation
  - **01_inbox/** - dev log and autobiographical memory

*other areas will emerge naturally as we use the system*

## what neuromancer does

while wintermute stores, neuromancer thinks:
- spots patterns across all your knowledge
- generates insights you might miss
- automates the boring organizational tasks
- helps you actually process information instead of just hoarding it
- enables proper ai-assisted research and creativity

## getting started

1. check out `0_admin/00_index/` for the system docs
2. read the structure guide so you know how to organize
3. start filling in areas that matter to your work
4. set up workflows between wintermute and neuromancer
