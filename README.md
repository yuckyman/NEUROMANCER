# neuromancer
## the thinking half of my digital brain

**neuromancer** is basically the analytical side that pairs with my **wintermute** obsidian vault. think of it like having two brain hemispheres but digital (gibson would be proud).

## the setup

```
wintermute          ←→          neuromancer
(storage brain)                 (processing brain)
- keeps everything             - analyzes patterns
- reference materials          - makes connections  
- structured notes            - synthesizes info
- static organization         - active thinking
```

## how it's organized

starting minimal with johnny decimal framework - folders grow organically as needed:

- **0_admin/** - system stuff, dev logs, configs
  - **00_index/** - main documentation
  - **01_inbox/** - dev log and autobiographical memory

*other areas will emerge naturally as i use the system*

## what neuromancer does

while wintermute stores, neuromancer thinks:
- spots patterns across all my knowledge
- generates insights i might miss
- automates the boring organizational tasks
- helps me actually process information instead of just hoarding it
- enables proper ai-assisted research and creativity

## getting started

1. check out `0_admin/00_index/` for the system docs
2. read the structure guide to understand organization
3. start filling in areas that matter to my work
4. set up workflows between wintermute and neuromancer
