II. Transformer-Based Models in EEG Analysis and Mental Imagery

This section focuses on advanced neural network architectures for processing Electroencephalography (EEG) data, particularly Transformer-based models, and their application to understanding mental imagery, including conditions like aphantasia.
1. Adaptive Computation Time (ACT)

    Core Idea: An algorithm for recurrent neural networks (RNNs) that allows the network to learn how many computational steps to take for each input before producing an output. This enables dynamic adaptation of computation based on task complexity.
    Mechanism: Augments RNN output with a sigmoidal "halting unit" whose activation determines the probability of continuing computation. A mean-field approach is used for updates, avoiding noisy gradients from stochastic sampling.
    Ponder Cost: A time cost (P(x)) is added to the loss function (L̂(x,y) = L(x,y) + τP(x)) to encourage parsimonious computation. τ is a hand-chosen time penalty parameter.
    Training Considerations: Halting unit bias (bh) can be initialized positively to prevent long sequences early on. A hard limit (M) on N(t) can be imposed to avoid excessive costs.
    Error Gradients: The ponder costs are discontinuous but are treated as constant for gradient calculation, minimizing R(t). Gradients are straightforward to compute for backpropagation.
    Experimental Results:Synthetic Problems (Parity, Logic, Addition, Sort): ACT dramatically improves performance, adapting computation to problem difficulty. Lower τ values generally lead to faster and more accurate solutions, but the optimal τ varies.
    Wikipedia Character Prediction: ACT does not yield large performance gains but provides insight into data structure, allocating more computation to harder-to-predict transitions (e.g., spaces, sentence ends). This suggests potential for inferring segment boundaries.
    Limitations: Sensitivity to the time penalty parameter (τ). Future work aims for automatic τ determination.

2. Spatio-Temporal EEG Data Analysis

    EEG Challenges: Capturing effective representations in unlabeled data, identifying complex patterns, and creating meaningful visualizations from abstract signals.
    Advancements (Deep Learning & AI):Representation Learning: Focuses on automatically extracting useful features from EEG signals, especially using Self-Supervised Learning (SSL) due to limited labeled data.
    Contrastive Learning: Learns invariant representations by maximizing similarity between similar samples and minimizing it for dissimilar ones. Often uses data augmentation (e.g., jittering, scaling, permutation) or expert knowledge to construct positive/negative pairs.
    Mask Autoencoder Approaches: Inspired by masked language modeling (like BERT), these methods mask portions of EEG data (temporal embeddings or frequency bands) and train models to reconstruct the missing content, learning intrinsic feature information.
    Discriminative EEG Analysis: Distinguishes patterns in EEG signals for tasks like epilepsy detection, sleep staging, and emotion recognition.
    Graph Neural Networks (GNNs): EEG channels are nodes; graph construction based on geometry (Euclidean distance) or functional connectivity (e.g., Pearson Correlation Coefficient, Mutual Information, Phase Locking Value). Adaptive graph learning strategies are explored. GNNs model spatial dependencies (graph diffusion convolution) and are combined with recurrent units (GRUs) for temporal dependencies.
    Foundation Models (FMs): Large-scale pre-trained neural networks trained on extensive datasets, possessing general knowledge and adaptable to specific EEG tasks via fine-tuning. Structures often combine CNN and Transformer layers. Training methods include masked autoencoders (MAE) and contrastive learning.
    Large Language Models (LLMs)-based Methods: Leverage LLMs for EEG analysis, either as feature extractors for unimodal data (fine-tuned with PEFT techniques for classification/forecasting) or for multimodal data (EEG paired with text, using knowledge distillation or cross-modal contrastive learning).
    Generative EEG Analysis: Produces new modalities (images, text, sound) from EEG data, offering novel visualization and interpretation.
    Image Generation: Encodes EEG signals into feature vectors to condition image generation models (e.g., VAE, GANs, Diffusion Models). Approaches include supervised classification for encoders or triplet loss-based contrastive learning.
    Text Generation: Treats EEG feature sequences as encoded sentences, mapping them to embeddings for pre-trained language models (e.g., BART) for open-vocabulary decoding or sentiment classification. Uses methods like vector quantized variational encoders for discrete encoding.
    Datasets & Metrics: Public (e.g., BCI Competition IV, TUH EEG Corpus, DEAP, CHB-MIT, SEED) and private datasets are used. Metrics include Accuracy, Precision, Recall, F1/F2 Score, AUC-ROC, MSE, MAE, Cohen’s Kappa, Inception Score (IS), Frechet Inception Distance (FID), Kernel Inception Distance (KID), Structural Similarity Index (SSIM), BLEU-N, ROUGE-1, Pearson Correlation Coefficient (PCC), Mel-cepstral distance.

3. EEGformer: Transformer-based Brain Activity Classification

    Problem: Existing Deep Learning (DL) models are not specifically optimized for unique EEG signal characteristics (temporal, regional, synchronous), limiting performance in SSVEP-based BCI tasks like glaucoma diagnosis. Manual feature extraction is inflexible.
    EEG Characteristics:Temporal: Fluctuations over time, abundant sampling points.
    Regional: Different brain regions linked to distinct EEG bands.
    Synchronous: Synchronous activity patterns across functional networks with similar spatial orientations.
    EEGformer Architecture: End-to-end DL model for raw EEG to task prediction.
    1DCNN (Depth-wise Convolution): Automatically extracts EEG-channel-wise features from raw EEG input, creating a 3D feature matrix (temporal, spatial, convolutional features). Data-driven feature extraction.
    EEGformer Encoder: Sequentially refines EEG characteristics.
    Regional Transformer: Segments 3D matrix along spatial dimension. Self-attention computed over convolutional features of a single brain region to capture mono-electrode convolutional feature contributions.
    Synchronous Transformer: Segments 3D matrix along convolutional feature dimension. Self-attention computed over feature maps extracted by the same depth-wise convolution to capture convolution features changing over time across specific EEG channels.
    Temporal Transformer: Compresses temporal dimensionality. Self-attention computed over temporal dimension to capture multiple electrode features changing over different convolutional features at a specific time.
    EEGformer Decoder: CNN-based for specific tasks (target frequency identification, emotion recognition, depression discrimination). Combines convolutional features, then spatial dimensions, reduces complexity, and finally uses a fully connected layer with softmax.
    Experimental Results:Performance: EEGformer achieves best classification on BETA (SSVEP-BCI), SEED (emotion recognition), and DepEEG (depression discrimination) datasets.
    Ablation Studies:Transformer Combinations: Full combination of regional, synchronous, and temporal transformers yields best results, supporting the unified learning hypothesis. Synchronous transformer particularly important.
    1DCNN: Using 1DCNN significantly improves performance, validating its data-driven feature extraction.
    EEG Channel Number: Performance increases with more EEG channels, showing model's ability to learn from complex data and that all channels can be informative.
    Comparison Studies (vs. EEGNet, Conv-CCA, 4DCRNN, EmotionNet, PCRNN): EEGformer consistently outperforms baselines, shows lowest standard deviation (better generalization), and is robust to segment length.
    Discussion & Future Work: Unified learning is key. DL methods are "black boxes," requiring explainable AI (XAI) to visualize learned features and connect to BFC. Need to address small dataset sizes (e.g., through training strategies like two-stage training).

4. Recurrent World Models (RWMs)

    Core Idea: Training a generative recurrent neural network (RNN) in an unsupervised manner to model reinforcement learning (RL) environments through compressed spatio-temporal representations. These models extract features used by compact policies trained by evolution.
    Agent Model Components:Vision (V): A Variational Autoencoder (VAE) compresses high-dimensional input observations (e.g., image frames) into a low-dimensional latent vector (z_t).
    Memory (M): A Mixture Density Network RNN (MDN-RNN) serves as a predictive model of future z_t vectors, outputting a probability density function p(z_t+1 | a_t, z_t, h_t). Can adjust a temperature parameter (τ) to control model uncertainty.
    Controller (C): A simple single-layer linear model that maps z_t and h_t to actions (a_t) to maximize cumulative reward. Designed to be minimal in parameters to allow for unconventional training (e.g., Evolution Strategies - CMA-ES).

    Training Procedure:Collect rollouts from a random policy.
    Train V (VAE) to encode frames into latent vectors.
    Train M (MDN-RNN) to model the probability distribution of the next latent vector.
    Evolve C to maximize expected cumulative reward, using V and M features as input.

    Key Contribution: The ability to train the controller (C) entirely inside of an environment generated by its own internal world model (M), then transfer this policy back to the actual environment.
    Cheating the World Model: M is an approximate probabilistic model and can be exploited by C if not careful. Increasing the temperature parameter (τ) in M makes the virtual environment noisier and more uncertain, preventing C from exploiting imperfections and encouraging more robust policies that transfer better to the real world.
    Related Work: Builds on earlier RNN-based world models, relates to PILCO (Gaussian processes), Bayesian neural networks, and model-based RL for high-dimensional visual data. Uses ES for controller training due to parallelization benefits and effectiveness for difficult RL tasks.
    Limitations & Future Work:VAE in V may encode irrelevant observations.
    Simpler tasks for current RWMs; need iterative training for complex environments (agent explores, model improves).
    Limited capacity of LSTM-based world models; future work could use higher capacity models or external memory.
    Current RWMs lack human-like hierarchical planning or abstract reasoning; future work explores more general "Learning To Think" approaches (e.g., C learning to address M subroutines).

5. Hierarchical Reasoning Models (HRMs)

    Core Concept: Aims to capture multi-timescale hierarchical computation and efficient, biologically plausible credit assignment in neural networks.
    Two Coupled Recurrent Modules:Low-level (L) Module: Performs fast, detailed updates, converging to a local equilibrium given the current high-level context. Simulates fast oscillatory search.
    High-level (H) Module: Updates more slowly (e.g., every T low-level steps), incorporating the settled output of L to shift the global strategy. Represents evolving abstract interpretation.
    "Nested" Update Scheme: L repeatedly converges conditioned on a quasi-static H, then H steps and resets context. Creates hierarchical convergence, avoiding premature flattening of effective depth.
    Efficient Credit Assignment: Uses a one-step gradient approximation (implicit function theorem) from deep equilibrium ideas. Backpropagates only through final equilibrium states for O(1) memory, aligning with local credit assignment intuition. Avoids biologically dubious replay of full histories.
    Adaptive Computation/Halting: Includes a mechanism for the network to decide whether to continue computation (additional cycles) or halt based on input complexity, analogous to adaptive computational time and cognitive effort/uncertainty.
    Brain Inspiration: Explicitly inspired by cortical hierarchies, distinct intrinsic timescales (theta vs. gamma rhythms), and recurrent feedback loops. "High-level planning" and "fast local refinement" are analogs of top-down attention and bottom-up sensory dynamics.

6. Integrating HRM with Transformer-based EEG Mental Imagery Pipeline (Project Idea)

    Proposed Integration: HRM sits "on top" of a transformer encoder (perceptual frontend) to add depth, multi-step refinement, and an internal hierarchy for distinguishing imagery quality, modality, or aphantasic signatures.

    Transformer Encoder: Processes patched EEG windows into contextual embeddings. Output (or a pooled/aggregated vector) becomes the HRM input representation.
    HRM Overlay: An input network maps transformer output to a working representation. The low-level module iterates rapidly to refine a latent state. The high-level module updates based on the converged low-level state (evolving abstract interpretation). An output head produces classification or embedding.

    Losses/Supervision: Primary: trial labels (imagery vs. perception, modality, subject grouping). Auxiliary: contrastive/clustering losses on HRM high-level embeddings.
    Attention Fusion: Transformer's attention maps can be fused with HRM dynamics to create a soft coupling between perceptual salience and reasoning depth.

7. Folding in Hierarchical Reasoning for Aphantasia Simulation/Lesioning

    Simulated Imagery Degradation (Aphantasia Proxies):Input Lesions: Drop out/filter specific frequency bands (e.g., attenuate alpha in occipital embeddings), or zero out posterior channel contributions before they enter the transformer. Observe how this propagates through the transformer and HRM.
    Internal Modulation: Degrade the influence of the high-level module (e.g., slow update frequency, add noise to updates, reduce cycles via halting) to mimic weakened abstract "guidance."
    Convergence Signature: Compare forward residual profiles; if imagery is impoverished, low-level module may fail to settle, or high-level corrections become erratic.
    Meta-uncertainty/Vividness: Use HRM's halting mechanism as a proxy for subjective confidence. More cycles = less vivid/stable imagery.
    Clustering Latent Styles: Cluster high-level hidden states/embeddings to see if imagery types (vivid vs. sparse) separate, and if aphantasia-like signatures form distinct manifolds.

8. Related Research on Aphantasia and EEG

    Aphantasia Definition: Diminished or absent capacity for visual imagery (inability to "see with the mind's eye"), affecting 3-4% of the population. Hyperphantasia is the opposite.
    Neural Correlates:fMRI: Low imagery vividness linked to broader, distinct neural networks (fusiform gyrus, posterior cingulate, parahippocampal gyrus). Aphantasics show reduced hippocampal engagement, increased visual perception area activity, and weaker connectivity between prefrontal and visual cortices.
    EEG (Case Studies): Atypical temporal activation during imagery tasks, normal RRN but atypical patterns for mirror-reversed stimuli in mental rotation.
    Group EEG Study (Morales-Gregorio et al.): Found a strong negative correlation between mental imagery vividness (VVIQ2 score) and eyes-closed resting-state occipital alpha power. Higher alpha oscillations linked to suppressed communication from V1 to higher cortical areas, potentially indicating less vivid or absent imagery. Alpha oscillations may be a biomarker.
    Group EEG Study (Boere et al.):P300 Signals: Aphantasic participants showed reduced P300 amplitudes during a visual oddball task, suggesting decreased attentional engagement and impaired episodic memory updating at the encoding stage.
    Frontal Delta Power: Lower frontal delta power during high-load n-back tasks suggested reduced reliance on internal imagery and less need to suppress external distractions (functional cortical deafferentation). Delta power positively correlated with VVIQ scores, suggesting it as a neural biomarker for vividness.
    Behavioral Performance: Often comparable between aphantasics and controls, suggesting compensatory strategies (e.g., semantic labeling over sensory-based representation, analytical strategies).
    Limitations in Aphantasia Research: Reliance on self-reported VVIQ scores, limited investigation of involuntary imagery, lack of explicit examination of cognitive strategies, and potential blurring of differences between "no imagery" (aphantasia) and "reduced imagery" (hypophantasia).

9. Deep Neural Networks and Human Shape Sensitivity

    Core Idea: State-of-the-art Convolutional Deep Neural Networks (DNNs) capture important aspects of human object perception, particularly human-like representation of object shape, even when not explicitly trained for shape processing.
    Evidence: DNNs explain human shape judgments for benchmark behavioral and neural stimulus sets where earlier models failed. They develop sensitivity to minute shape variations and "non-accidental properties" (NAPs) crucial for object recognition.
    Shape vs. Category: DNNs trained for object categorization implicitly learn shape representations that reflect human shape perception more strongly than category representations. Category information, while present, is less dominant in DNNs than in humans.
    Feedforward vs. Recurrent Architectures: Current DNNs are primarily feedforward. While humans can perform many tasks feedforward, they also benefit from recurrent processing, especially for perceptual organization and complex segmentation. Recurrent Neural Networks (RNNs) that incorporate feedforward complexity might better fit human perception.
    Interpretability: The "available information" in a model (what a classifier could learn) differs from its "represented information" (what it implicitly learns). Comparing representational spaces in models and humans helps understand if models implicitly develop human-like representations, independent of specific task training.

Quiz Answer Key

    The primary objectives of a Master's thesis in the CCSE are to provide an opportunity for research, contribute to the body of knowledge, and allow students to acquire in-depth domain expertise for degree fulfillment. Benefits include demonstrating expertise, problem-solving ability, and readiness for further education or publications.
    The thesis proposal should be approximately 5-10 pages long and is due by the end of the third week of the first term of thesis registration. It must include the thesis topic and its significance, the specific research question, a bibliography with explanations of source utility, and a plan for data gathering and analysis.
    For satisfactory progress, a student receives an "IP" grade for a thesis term. Upon successful defense of the thesis and fulfillment of all other requirements, the graduate coordinator will change all previous "IP" grades to "S," indicating successful completion.
    Adaptive Computation Time (ACT) is an algorithm that augments recurrent neural networks with a sigmoidal halting unit. This unit learns when to stop computation for an input, allowing the network to dynamically adjust the number of computational steps based on the problem's complexity.
    ACT dramatically improves performance on synthetic problems, where it successfully adapts the number of computational steps to the problem's requirements, often leading to more rapid and accurate solutions. However, for real-world tasks like Wikipedia character prediction, ACT does not yield large performance gains but provides insightful information about data structure by allocating more computation to harder-to-predict transitions.
    Two challenges in EEG analysis include the effective capture of representations from EEG data, especially in the absence of labels, and the identification and classification of complex and subtle patterns within brain activity. Additionally, creating meaningful visualizations or interpretations from abstract EEG signals is a significant challenge.
    GNNs incorporate spatial information by treating each EEG channel as a node in a graph. Two common methods for constructing EEG graphs are based on the geometry of EEG channels (e.g., Euclidean distance between electrodes) or on functional connectivity between brain regions (e.g., Pearson Correlation Coefficient).
    Foundation Models in EEG analysis are large-scale pre-trained neural networks, often combining CNN and Transformer layers, trained on extensive datasets. Their primary advantage is that they learn a vast range of general knowledge about time series signals, allowing them to effectively represent EEG data and generalize to various downstream tasks with minimal fine-tuning, addressing the challenge of limited labeled medical data.
    The EEGformer model aims to capture temporal characteristics, referring to fluctuations over time and abundant sampling points in EEG data, and regional characteristics, which link different brain regions to distinct EEG bands. It also captures synchronous characteristics, representing synchronous brain activity patterns across functional networks.
    The reduced P300 amplitude in aphantasics during an oddball task suggests diminished attentional engagement and impaired episodic memory updating at the encoding stage. Lower frontal delta power during high-load n-back tasks indicates reduced reliance on internally generated imagery and less need to suppress external distractions, suggesting a different cognitive strategy for task performance.

    Ponder Cost: A term in Adaptive Computation Time (ACT) that quantifies the computational effort expended by the network, added to the loss function to encourage efficiency.
    Recurrent Neural Network (RNN): A class of neural networks where connections between nodes form a directed graph along a sequence, allowing them to process sequential data and maintain an internal state or "memory."
    Reinforcement Learning (RL): An area of machine learning concerned with how intelligent agents ought to take actions in an environment to maximize the notion of cumulative reward.
    Representation Learning: The process of automatically discovering useful representations of raw data for machine learning tasks, often in a lower-dimensional and more abstract form.
    Self-Attention Mechanism: A core component of Transformer models that allows the model to weigh the importance of different parts of the input sequence when processing each element.
    Self-Supervised Learning (SSL): A paradigm of machine learning where the model learns representations from unlabeled data by solving automatically generated pretext tasks, using the data itself as supervision.
    Semi-Supervised Learning: A type of machine learning that utilizes a small amount of labeled data with a large amount of unlabeled data during training.
    Spatio-Temporal Data: Data that has both spatial (location) and temporal (time) dimensions, such as EEG signals which vary across brain regions and over time.
    Steady-State Visual Evoked Potentials (SSVEPs): Oscillatory brain responses elicited by periodic visual stimulation, commonly used in BCI applications and for evaluating visual pathway function.
    Stereoelectroencephalography (SEEG): An invasive method for recording brain activity using electrodes surgically implanted directly into the brain.
    Structural Connectivity: The physical connections (e.g., white matter tracts) between different brain regions.
    τ (Tau): In ACT, a time penalty parameter that weights the relative cost of computation versus prediction error. In RWMs, a temperature parameter controlling model uncertainty during sampling.
    Temporal Patching: A technique used in Transformer-based models for time-series data, where continuous time-series data is divided into fixed-size "patches" or "windows" that are then treated as tokens for the model.
    Transformer (Model): A neural network architecture based on the self-attention mechanism, highly effective for sequence-to-sequence tasks and known for its ability to capture long-range dependencies.
    Variational Autoencoder (VAE): A generative model that learns a compressed latent representation of data by encoding inputs into a probability distribution and then decoding samples from that distribution.
    Vividness of Visual Imagery Questionnaire (VVIQ): A self-report questionnaire used to measure the subjective vividness of an individual's mental imagery.
    World Model: In reinforcement learning, a learned model of the environment that predicts future states and rewards given current states and actions, allowing an agent to plan or simulate.
