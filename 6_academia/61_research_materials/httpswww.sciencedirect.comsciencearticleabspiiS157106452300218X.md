## Highlights

- •
	Visual Mental Imagery (VMI) is a flexible cognitive ability that can be deployed towards various stimulus domains, including object shape, object color, written words, , and spatial relationships.
- •
	VMI is supported by a heterarchical architecture encompassing horizontal and vertical connections among domain-preferring and domain-general network modules.
- •
	The heterarchical architecture of VMI centers around the function of a node in the left ventrotemporal cortex, the Fusiform Imagery Node, for the visualization of mental images.
- •
	Additional network modules spread around the frontoparietal, anterior temporal and hippocampal regions support generation, maintenance, and simulation of visual images from and their meaning.

## Introduction

There is no limit to human imagination, according to Willy Wonka: *“... If you want to view paradise, Simply look around and view it, Anything you want to, do it…”.* This notion captures the essence of Visual Mental Imagery (VMI), enabling us to envision people, places, and objects not physically present \[55,125\]. Within scientific literature, the term VMI serves as a broad umbrella, encompassing various phenomena and processes associated with mental imagery. For instance, VMI can be placed at the core of human cognition. Mental images derived from long-term memory enable us to anticipate suitable behavioral responses in our environment \[26,82\]. However, a comprehensive review of studies exploring potential differences in imagining stimuli from various domains is missing. Such an exploration could contribute to resolving ongoing questions and debates regarding the mechanisms underlying VMI.

This review begins by probing a fundamental question: how is VMI studied? Subsequently, it delves into another pivotal question concerning the relationship between VMI and perception. Does imagining an object pose greater difficulty than perceiving it? Assessing whether such an increase in difficulty exists, and whether it remains consistent across various visual perceptual domains can shed light on the comparable mechanisms underlying imagery and perception with a greater detail than our current understanding allows.

The last question concerns the neural architecture supporting VMI across different domains. Past propositions suggested a hierarchical architecture supporting VMI, with frontal regions occupying the highest level in this hierarchy \[35\], \[58\], early sensory regions at its lowest level, and a reversed flow of information compared to perception \[33\], \[35\], \[130\]. However, this model has faced recent scrutiny, with persistent unanswered questions. For instance, neurological patients typically display VMI deficits after left inferior temporal lobe damage but not after early visual cortex damage (e.g., \[94\], see reviews \[125\] and \[6\]). On the other hand, we recently discussed the case of a stroke patient with preserved mental imagery and right homonymous hemianopia, alexia without agraphia, and color anomia \[55\]. Patient RDS regions in the Ventro-Temporal Cortex (VTC) and associated white matter tracts were spared by the lesion. How can this evidence be reconciled within models proposing the complete spatial overlap between imagery and perception? Moreover, disparities in early stages of imagery and perception processes in terms of brain regions activated and temporal dynamics \[22,34,35\] pose further challenges. We recently uncovered the reduced functional connectivity between frontoparietal and ventral temporal cortex (VTC) regions in subjects with aphantasia but preserved visual perception \[82\], \[147\], suggesting VMI generation dependence on specific network connectivity. How does this finding go along with previously stipulated imagery as vision in reverse \[100\]? Current evidence fails to definitively map the neurocognitive architecture of VMI within a hierarchical structure, beyond identifying sequential processing stages (ie., a cascade; \[33\]). Yet, identifying a sequence of neural events does not imply a hierarchy among them, but highlights the order in which the events typically occur under certain stimulus-specific conditions. Each step is essential and contributes to the final result, and none of them is inherently more essential or necessary than the others.

Long-standing evidence links brain regions in the ventral temporal cortex (VTC) to the processing of domain-specific visual information by responding more strongly to stimuli of a preferred type (hereafter, domain-preferring regions). Generation and maintenance of visible stimuli relies on occipito-temporal circuits along well-charted territories in the dorsal and ventral cortical visual streams \[84\], \[148\]. These regions seem to play a similar role between imagery and perception, being a potential candidate for the overlap between these two processes. For example, activation of the fusiform face area in the right hemisphere is associated with both imagery (e.g., \[67\]) and perception \[69\] of faces. Similarly, patients with prosopagnosia due to lesions of the occipitotemporal region encompassing the fusiform face area can develop selective deficits in face imagery \[13\]. Brain activation associated with perception and imagery of colors overlaps in regions such as the fusiform gyrus and in the insular cortex \[63\]. Color perception is also associated with activation of the primary visual cortex, while color imagery is not \[63,82\]. This complex scenario challenges existing models that propose a unidirectional signal flow between prefrontal regions and the primary visual regions for all visual imagination. Addressing these complexities and nuances in neurocognitive models is essential to develop a more detailed understanding of VMI across diverse semantic domains.

In summary, to draw a revised neurocognitive model of VMI, it becomes imperative to (1) re-evaluate existing literature by clarifying the necessity of VTC regions and their interplay in VMI, (2) accommodate differences between imagery and perception by stipulating alternatives to single-stream reverse-hierarchy models, and (3) offer testable predictions for various domains of mental imagery. A heterarchical organization could provide such alternatives to the current hierarchical neural model. Heterarchical systems, first introduced by neurophysiologists \[89\], mix hierarchy (vertical connections) with horizontal processes (lateral connections), allowing top-down and bottom-up feedback signals to co-exist within a model. Hence, this architecture stands out as a potential candidate for VMI sub-networks to interact with each other following previously discovered processing stages (e.g., \[33,130\]). At the same time, it would free the model from making predictions regarding the importance of nodes within this architecture. Further, this model could produce testable predictions regarding VMI of specific domains by linking domain-general and domain-preferring regions (see Fig. 1).

Here, we review the literature on five semantic domains used in VMI literature \[6,49\] to highlight the similarities between behavioral and neural findings observed across these studies. As of January 1st, 2023, we identified over 60 articles focused on VMI: visuospatial imagery (rotations and trajectories; n = 22 articles), faces (n = 13 articles), colors (n = 11 articles), shapes (n = 9 articles), and letters (n = 9 articles). This effort aims at understanding how VMI is studied, what makes it different from perception, and what organizational structure supports it. We will highlight evidence in favor of the hierarchical model (see Pearson et al., for a list of predictions) and a heterarchical model of VMI. This model predicts that a region located in the left fusiform gyrus, the fusiform imagery node (FIN) \[127\] is a central hub for VMI. The FIN connects high-level visual areas processing domain-specific information with other regions in the temporal lobe implicated in memory- and semantic-related processes. Direct lesion or disconnection of the FIN from more anterior regions should produce domain-general deficits of VMI \[8\]. Regions processing domain-specific information for mental imagery are also located in the VTC. The model predicts activation of fusiform face area (FFA) and parahippocampal place area (PPA) during imagery of faces and places, respectively, activation of the lateral occipital complex (LOC) for shape imagery, in the visual word form area (VWFA) for letter imagery, and in the color-biased region for color imagery. Lesion or disconnection of domain-preferring regions in the VTC should instead produce domain-specific deficits of VMI \[9\]. This model also predicts that greater vividness of mental imagery would be associated with higher connectivity between FIN and frontoparietal regions linked by the superior longitudinal fasciculus and by the arcuate fasciculus. Collectively, the divergent predictions stemming from the models provide an ideal arena for exploration within this review.

## Section snippets

## Visuospatial mental imagery (trajectories and rotation)

With the term visuospatial imagery, we refer to a wide range of abilities, including visualizing and manipulating objects (e.g. rotations and spatial trajectories) as well as evaluating their spatial features (viewpoint and relative position, relative distance, and configuration) \[110,111\].

Shepard & Metzler \[117\] devised a mental construction task (CONS) to assess the *rotation* aspect of visuospatial imagery. Participants saw pairs of three-dimensional objects made out of cubes attached together

## Mental Imagery of Faces

The ability to visualize whole or parts of people's faces \[96\], is involved in a variety of every-day activities \[45\]. For instance, mental imagery of faces can be used to visualize the face of our neighbor, but it also contributes to prejudicial schemas based on a subjective representation of how our new neighbor should look.

Ishai et al. \[67\] used fMRI to compare the activation of brain regions between visual imagery and perception associated with faces, houses and chairs. Results of face

## Mental Imagery of Colors

Color mental imagery has been defined as the ability to recall and manipulate colors at will \[7,11,40\]. Color imagery can be used to enhance the creativity of the mind's eye. For example, painters might use color imagery to envision how a painting might look and what it can become. The literature on mental imagery of color features several single case studies of patients who have sudden vision loss and sudden color blindness but are still able to mentally visualize color (recently reviewed in

## Discussion

Over the past three decades, the field of human mental imagery has witnessed substantial advancements. We reviewed the findings derived from studies exploring visual mental imagery (VMI) across five domains. At the outset, we formulated three objectives: 1) examining the methodologies employed in VMI research, 2) comparing behavioral results between imagery domains and perception, and 3) reviewing evidence regarding the neurocognitive architecture supporting VMI. In the subsequent discussion,

## Conclusion

In summary, the complexities of visual mental imagery defies simple accounts invoking “a reverse” of visual perception, or a top-down only process. Rather, activation of domain-preferring regions, attentional and working memory mechanisms, and episodic memory and semantic processes all contribute to this complex cognitive function. Domain-general regions for activation and generation of mental images located in the frontoparietal networks interplay with a domain-general region in the left

- ### Phantasia, aphantasia, and hyperphantasia: Empirical data and conceptual considerations
	2024, Neuroscience and Biobehavioral Reviews
	Citation Excerpt:
	In neurotypical subjects attempting visual mental imagery tasks, initial studies reported selective activation of cortical regions specialised for perception of faces or places respectively according to task, suggesting common processing mechanisms for imagery and perception (O’Craven and Kanwisher, 2000) although with different network dynamics (Lee et al., 2012; Dijkstra et al., 2018). However, meta-analyses of fMRI studies (Spagna et al., 2021, 2024) have shown no evidence for imagery-related activity in early visual cortices, whereas fronto-parietal networks and a region of the left fusiform gyrus, a high-level visual region, were engaged. The “language-game of inventing a name for something” as described by Ludwig Wittgenstein (Philosophical Investigations §27) is familiar enough in neurology and neuroscience but does not necessarily imply a new discovery.

	2024, Journal of Neuroscience Methods
	Citation Excerpt:
	Single-Field classification studies were carried out utilizing BCICIV2a to confirm the efficacy and precision of the suggested technique. Our approach's accuracy was evaluated in comparison to that of DL-based methods such as MSFBCNN (Iliopoulos and Papasotiriou, 2022), WTL (Spagna et al., 2024), EEGNet (Wang et al., 2023a), MCCNN (Zhong et al., 2023), M3DCNN (Xu et al., 2023), EEG-TCNet (Li et al., 2019), CPMixedNet (Yang et al., 2024), DMTLCNN (Wei et al., 2023), and the ML-based method FBCSP (Stam, 2005). You can see the findings in Table 5, where the highest accuracy is bolded.
- ### Aphantasia and involuntary imagery
	2024, Consciousness and Cognition
	Citation Excerpt:
	The differences observed between aphantasics and imagers suggest that involuntary images, in this case ones that occur in interaction with perception, can also be impaired in aphantasia. This interaction likely occurs due to shared (though not entirely overlapping) neural representations between imagery and perception (Cichy et al., 2012; Xie et al., 2020; Spagna et al., 2024), also leading to effects of aphantasia on perceptual processes (Liu & Bartolomeo, 2023), such as visual search (Monzel, Keidel, & Reuter, 2021; Monzel & Reuter, 2023) and sensory sensitivity (Dance et al., 2021). Now, aphantasics were still about twice as likely to experience pseudo-hallucinations than not, when viewing the flicker, suggesting that this kind of involuntary image may be preserved in aphantasia.
